print("Lorekeeper Mail!")

-- The purpose of this addon is so that the savedvariables of gathered mail items from the Lorekeeper addon are kept separate, and therefore private.
-- A user who wishes to upload their Lorekeeper data won't need to remove their mails from the upload, as it won't contain mail.
