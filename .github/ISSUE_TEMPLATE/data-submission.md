If you're submitting data to be contributed, find it within your WoW install at `_retail_\WTF\Account\<YourAccountName>\SavedVariables\Lorekeeper.lua`. Attach the .lua file to this issue.

If you would like to be credited for your submission, please provide a username or some sort of online handle by which you want to be addressed as (this is public info in an addon): 

Do not include Lorekeeper_Mail.lua as it is *not* a necessary upload and contains your personal mail items and custom items. It will not be contributed to the addon.
