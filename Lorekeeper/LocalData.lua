					"Jubeka's Journal\r\n\r\nThis document contains the daily journal of one of the master Warlock trainers. The pages are filled with random notes, the occasional drawing of an imp's internal organs and the occasional tidbit on the preferred diet of felhunters.\r\n\r\nNear the end, an entry catches your eye...",
					"Day 26:\r\n\r\nIt has been nearly two weeks since Kanrethad and I arrived in Outland. Almost immediately afterwards, he departed for Shadowmoon Valley. I didn't bother to ask why, as long as he doesn't get himself killed. \r\n\r\nMy research here in this dusty wasteland continues as drudgingly expected. While the Legion's onslaught has subsided, a number of the rarer demon specimens remain.",
					"Day 28:\r\n\r\nThe fel imps of the Path of Anguish in Hellfire are remarkably chatty. I've discovered that they're just as easy to contract into service as their names are to learn. The ritual to summon one is trivial, at best. \r\n\r\nVoidlords are rather difficult to stumble across, but it takes very little persuading to convince one to divulge the name of a rival lord.\r\n\r\nI have wondered once or twice if Kanrethad will ever return, but in the end, it doesn't actually matter. The council can put me to death, so long as my grimoires last, so will my legacy.",
					"Day 32:\r\n\r\nWhile examining the nauseating Ruins of Farahlon today in Netherstorm, I was ambushed by a race of floating eyeball squids. Calling themselves observers, they were unexpectedly intelligent. They expressed a deep desire to bear witness to all forms of magic and willingly offered their services in exchange for the opportunity to consume new forms of magic. \r\n\r\nThe ritual to summon an observer is unexpectedly complex. While natives of the great dark beyond, they are highly migratory and the summoning ritual must compensate for their travels. Without their willing assistance, summoning an observer would be nearly impossible.",
					"Day 35: \r\n\r\nKanrethad returned, looking incredibly grim. Considering his undisciplined technique, it should be no surprise that his research has been less than successful.\r\n\r\nI'm ready to attempt the binding of a higher order member of the Burning Legion, but I dare not attempt the ritual alone. In fact, perhaps Kanrethad would prove the perfect test subject...",
					"Day 36:\r\n\r\nRemarkable! My first attempt to summon a higher order member of the legion failed as spectacularly as planned. The shivarra broke free almost instantly after Kanrethad completed the ritual. \r\n\r\nI expected the frail human to be struck down while I banished the creature. Instead, in the instant that the shivarra's razor-sharp blades sliced through the air, Kanrethad's form shifted and the blades bounced as if striking stone.\r\n\r\nUnlike the typical form of metamorphosis, he did not complete the demonic transformation... perhaps his research has been more successful than I expected.",
					"Day 40:\r\n\r\nThe key to binding a wrathguard was ironically reducing the number of runic symbols used in the summoning circle. Wrathguards are highly resistant to charms and compulsions, but readily respond to basic expressions of strength. \r\n\r\nKanrethad was unexpectedly insightful into the conditioning the Legion uses to compel the wrathguard into action. His ability to express his dominance over lesser demons is remarkable, if short-lived. With great pains, I've been able to inscribe the forms he uses to summon multiple demonic servants at once. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, while he can bind two lesser demons indefinitely, I can only do so for a short time.",
					"Day 47: \r\n\r\nWe left a few ogre corpses in our wake, but studying the ritual circle of Vim'gol revealed additional ways of bolstering our power using demonic sacrifices. While the act greatly enrages our demonic servants, fusing their life energy to our own provides a dramatic increase in power.\r\n\r\nWith a little experimentation, I discovered that the more closely linked you are with the demon you sacrifice, the greater the power of the ritual.\r\n\r\nKanrethad's ability to restrain his demonic transformation seems to have reached a plateau. Once again, his lack of power disgusts me. Things that would be trivial to most Warlocks take him an eternity.",
					"Day 50: \r\n\r\nAt Kanrethad's insistence, we headed for the Altar of Damnation in Shadowmoon Valley. He seems to be convinced that there's more to the Hand of Gul'dan than just a show of power.\r\n\r\nI'm not convinced, but at this point my grimoires are complete. I don't understand his obsession with controlling the flow of demonic power granted by his transformation. \r\n\r\nWhile he plays around with ancient altars, I intend to try my hand at opening a gateway to conjure many wild imps at once...",
					"Day 60:\r\n\r\nKanrethad is up to something. To say that I'm concerned about our next move is a dramatic understatement.",
					"(A ragged note is drawn onto the back cover of the leather journal)\r\n\r\nI'm convinced there is no chance that we will return from this next adventure alive. There's simply no way I can take the risk that my grimoires go unread. For that reason, I've contracted the imps to leave four fragments of my soulstone at the locations listed in my journal.\r\n\r\nI'm sending this journal to you, my trusted friend, that should the need to locate me arise, you bring the four stones together, find my body and ensure that my grimoires are brought back to Azeroth.\r\n\r\nSigned,\r\nJubeka Shadowbreaker",

According to whom? It was these titans who maligned the glory of the Black Empire.",

One by one, the elemental lords fell, and their forces dispersed. \r\n\r\n<A note has been scribbled on the page.>\r\nThe titans do love to make themselves seem grandiose. History, is as always, written by the victor.",

Without the Old Gods\' power to keep their raging spirits bound to the physical world, the elementals were banished to an abyssal plane, where they would contend with one another for all eternity. With the elementals\' departure, nature calmed, and the world settled into a peaceful harmony. The Titans saw that the threat was contained and set to work.\r\n\r\n<A note has been scribbled on the page.>\r\nFools! The power of the elements was not so easily contained. Nor could they bind the influence of the Old Gods. The "peace" the titans offered came only through oppression.',

To help them carve out the fathomless caverns beneath the earth, the Titans created the dwarf-like earthen from magical, living stone. To help them dredge out the seas and lift the land from the sea floor, the Titans created the immense but gentle sea giants. For many ages the Titans moved and shaped the earth, until at last there remained one perfect continent. \r\n\r\n<A note has been scribbled on the page.>\r\nThe author of this tome is either a liar or a fool. Were they truly ignorant of that which lies beyond the waves? Or were they merely commanded to spread titan propaganda?",
					"At the continent's center, the Titans crafted a lake of scintillating energies. The lake, which they named the Well of Eternity, was to be the fount of life for the world. Its potent energies would nurture the bones of the world and empower life to take root in the land's rich soil. Over time, plants, trees, monsters, and creatures of every kind began to thrive on the primordial continent. \r\n\r\n<A note has been scribbled on the page.>\r\nThe titans wounded the world with their recklessness, then insisted it was done by design. Preposterous! It was the Old Gods who nurtured the flesh of this world, not the titans!",

They even stole away the land\'s true name and replaced it with one of their own.',

During the War of the Ancients, Sargeras gifted one of his favored necrolytes with this infernal blade.

Over the millennia, these demons were not idle. The dreadlord Ulthalesh ruled the pocket dimension with an iron fist, plotting for the day when he would exact vengeance. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nWhen Sargeras shattered Mardum to recruit forces for the Burning Legion, he offered his former prisoners an ultimatum: join him or be cast into oblivion. Most of the demons accepted, but scores refused, rallying around Ulthalesh. In answer to the challenge, Sargeras forged a great felsteel scythe from the fires of Mardum\'s destruction, and he used it to harvest the souls of the recalcitrant demons, confining them in a new prison. Ulthalesh, strongest of will, was the last to be devoured.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

Ulthalesh\'s spirit gave the weapon unfathomable strength, but with that strength came a curse, for those who bore Ulthalesh were inevitably consumed by it. The scythe would obey its masters\' commands until they were mortally wounded; then Ulthalesh would feast on their souls. Over the centuries, Sargeras bestowed the blade upon cunning nathrezim, ferocious doomlords, and even potent demigods, only to see their spirits devoured by Ulthalesh after they fell. The scythe grew stronger with each master it absorbed, and it became difficult for Sargeras to find servants who could control the weapon. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nOver the wailing of souls trapped within the scythe, the Dark Titan could hear Ulthalesh\'s grim laughter. \r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,<BR/>Part Three</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nDuring the War of the Ancients, the peoples of Azeroth rebelled against the Burning Legion\'s invasion, and Sargeras sought to break their will with Ulthalesh. But first, he had to find a servant who was powerful enough to wield it. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nHis thoughts turned to the eredar Sataiel. She was the first necrolyte with the strength to command the spirits of the living and the dead with fel magic, a feat that rivaled even Kil\'jaeden\'s necromantic abilities. She was also notoriously ambitious, and fearless to the point of arrogance. Ulthalesh\'s baleful reputation did not sway her. When Sargeras gifted her with the weapon, she accepted it eagerly.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"I shall be its final master," Sataiel said. \r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,<BR/>Part Four</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nMillennia ago, Sargeras gave Ulthalesh to Sataiel and commanded her to reap the souls of Azeroth\'s rebellious denizens, starting with the area that would later be known as Deadwind Pass. No one knows what the land was called before the coming of Sataiel. Most would rather not think of it at all. It is the burial site of countless trolls who were methodically slain, their spirits consumed by Ulthalesh, fueling its power to murder more. The scythe would feed and feed until all of the inhabitants were dead. \r\n<BR/><BR/>But Sataiel knew this was just the beginning, a promising start that only hinted at what Ulthalesh was capable of. Sargeras had dispatched her to break the will of Azeroth\'s denizens. It was not enough simply to kill them; bodies could be buried and forgotten. She decided to strike at the very heart of the land so that no new life could take up residence. With Ulthalesh, she would see that Deadwind Pass stood as a monument to the Legion\'s wrath. \r\n\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,<BR/>Part Five</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nUlthalesh has had many masters, but Sataiel was the first to discover the scythe\'s true potential. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAfter she used Ulthalesh to consume the souls of all living creatures in Deadwind Pass, she turned the blade on the land itself, draining it of life. The trees were reduced to withered husks. The marshes became a desiccated waste. The sky turned a sepulchral gray, the sun covered in a burial shroud. Sataiel relished the despair of the scythe\'s new prisoners as they unwittingly assisted in the annihilation of their home. The destruction was absolute. Even Azeroth\'s slumbering world-soul quailed. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSataiel was impressed with her handiwork. So was Ulthalesh.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,<BR/>Part Six</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nFrom the journal of Sataiel, recovered from the ruins of Deadwind Pass:\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"I surveyed the ruination I had wrought with great Ulthalesh, and it was glorious. The land was a mausoleum. Everywhere was blight, decay, destruction-except for one area. The explosive force from our ritual had carved a massive crater into the ground, and it roiled with unnatural energies, forming a magical nexus. I knew in my bones that I had birthed a fount of power more potent than the scythe itself.\r\n<BR/><BR/>"I must inform Sargeras. But something gives me pause, something I cannot dismiss. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"What claim does Sargeras have to this power? Who else but I could have wielded the scythe to the fullness of its potential? No one. Ulthalesh knows this. He urges me not to surrender our progeny. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"With such strength at our command, he says we may one day challenge Sargeras."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,<BR/>Part Seven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nLike all who presume to wield this pernicious blade, Sataiel was ambitious, strong willed, and supremely confident. She had come to Azeroth to prove herself to Sargeras, but when she saw the heights of power she could reach with Ulthalesh, she wondered whether she\'d set her sights too low. She had massacred thousands, turned the land into a tomb, and ripped open a magical nexus of unspeakable force. Her destiny was bright, and she needed no one\'s patronage to achieve it.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nUlthalesh whispered to Sataiel from the scythe, infecting her mind. She decided to keep the magical nexus for herself, and she cast potent wards to hide it from the outside world. Then she cut off all contact with the Legion, biding her time until she and Ulthalesh had the strength to challenge the Dark Titan. \r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,<BR/>Part Eight</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nFor centuries, the necrolyte Sataiel guarded Ulthalesh and hoarded the magical nexus they had created. When Sargeras discovered her deception, he was furious. The fount of power was his by right, and Sataiel was keeping it from him. Not only that, but his spies informed him that she was harboring delusions of grandeur, conspiring with the spirit of Ulthalesh to slay Sargeras. Such arrogance could not go unpunished. The upstart eredar had to be eliminated. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSargeras found his champion in Scavell, the Guardian of Tirisfal. He sent the Guardian visions of a dangerous entity lurking in Deadwind Pass, a demon awaiting the return of the Burning Legion. Scavell boldly took up the charge, hunting down Sataiel and, after an epic battle, slaying her with her own weapon. Her soul was cast screaming into the scythe.\r\n<BR/><BR/>As the Guardian examined the blade, he was filled with dread. Rarely had he seen so mighty an instrument of death, and though he had slain its bearer, he wondered whether the real threat remained unchecked. He decided to hide Ulthalesh where no one would find it.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,<BR/>Part Nine</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nEmpowered by Sataiel\'s spirit, the scythe had grown immeasurably stronger. There seemed to be no limit to how powerful it could become. Sargeras knew of Ulthalesh\'s scheming, of his promises to Sataiel that they could one day rival the Dark Titan. Although he dismissed this as mere bravado, he refused to give Ulthalesh the opportunity to make good on his threat. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Centuries after Scavell hid Ulthalesh, Sargeras twisted the Guardian Medivh\'s mind so he would assist him in regaining control of the scythe. The Guardian became obsessed with this task, and he dispatched the cursed Dark Riders to search for the blade and bring it back to the tower of Karazhan, which had been built on top of the magical nexus in Deadwind Pass--the nexus that Sataiel and Ulthalesh had created. Sargeras was pleased. It was only a matter of time before the Dark Riders would find the weapon, making a mockery of Ulthalesh\'s ambitions.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,<BR/>Part Ten</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nSo powerful was Medivh\'s charge that the Dark Riders continued their quest for Ulthalesh even after the Guardian\'s death. Eventually, their leader, Ariden, was drawn to the scythe when he sensed the keening of the trapped souls within, and he brought it to the catacombs beneath Karazhan. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAriden lacked the willpower and ingenuity of Sataiel, and his stewardship of Ulthalesh did not last long. There are conflicting reports about how he met his end. Some say he succumbed to the scythe\'s curse after he was defeated in battle, but others tell a different story. By all accounts, however, Ulthalesh went missing soon after Ariden\'s death. Its current whereabouts are unknown. Legend holds that only an individual of exceptional skill and fortitude can control it now.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

The Deadwind Harvester, Ulthalesh, is one of them. The necrolyte Sataiel regrets that she did not attempt to slay the fallen titan with it when she had the chance, so she will test whoever dares to wield the weapon in her stead. Ulthalesh does not mind. The scythe\'s master will either overcome Sataiel or be consumed, which will only make the blade more powerful. And then another bearer will take their place. And another.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"Ulthalesh has been playing this game with Sargeras for millennia. He knows the meaning of patience."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

He gazed into the depths of the Great Dark Beyond and embraced that which gazed back. He saw worlds consumed by fel fire, dark creatures of the Twisting Nether overrunning mortal civilizations, the conquest of creation. Now all that remains of him is this skull, which lends the bearer his power to command demons. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nLike most skulls, Thal\'kiel\'s comes with a cautionary tale. Never mind that it\'s been heeded by none.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part One</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nBefore the coming of Sargeras to Argus, the eredar Thal\'kiel ushered in a golden age for his people. Thal\'kiel was a sorcerer of unparalleled talent, and he and his Wakeners pushed the limits of summoning and binding magics, conjuring the arcane entities that helped build the capital\'s wondrous architecture. Thal\'kiel also devised the machines that focused the world\'s latent arcane energy, suffusing Argus with peace, harmony, and vitality. All were in awe of his abilities, including his young apprentice, Archimonde. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThere were rumors that Archimonde coveted Thal\'kiel\'s power and influence, but the eredar leader dismissed these as pure fabrication, for his apprentice had shown him nothing but devotion. Archimonde had even gone to great lengths to commission a custom-made crown for Thal\'kiel, taking the measurements for his head himself.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Two</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThal\'kiel led an order of eredar magi called the Wakeners, specialists in the arts of conjuration and binding. They were renowned for their clever arcane constructs, exploring new frontiers in summoning. Yet Thal\'kiel was never one to rest on his laurels. He thirsted for more. Seeking to elevate his order to levels undreamed of, he searched uncharted terrain, venturing farther than any eredar had dared before. His spells plumbed the vastness of the Great Dark Beyond, petitioning for a deeper well of power.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nOne day, he received an answer.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Three</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThal\'kiel was brilliant, but he was not wise. A dark presence whispered to him, and the eredar\'s mind was consumed with visions of power beyond his wildest imaginings, of ranks upon ranks of deadly servants eager to obey his every whim. These demonic forces made Thal\'kiel\'s arcane constructs look like a child\'s playthings. Afterward, he would despise the arcane, his passion reserved only for fel magic. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThal\'kiel\'s mysterious benefactor bestowed upon him the ability to summon lesser demons, and the eredar immediately spread the knowledge to his Wakeners. Imps and felhounds, infernals and abyssals, all executed the commands of Thal\'kiel and his sorcerers. Convinced that this was the start of a new era, Thal\'kiel feverishly prepared to present his wondrous pets to the rulers of Argus, Velen and Kil\'jaeden.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBrilliant. Not wise.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Four</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nIn the presence of Velen, Kil\'jaeden, and the eredar rulers\' inner circle, the sorcerer Thal\'kiel demonstrated what his fel darlings could do. First, he summoned scores of his familiar arcane constructs and arrayed them in orderly rows. Then the sky went dark, and the clouds roiled as a storm of meteors crashed down. From the craters emerged an army of infernals--which Thal\'kiel unleashed on the constructs. It was a symbolic display of the new era he saw for his people. He watched rapturously as the demons obliterated the unfortunate arcane entities, smashing and burning them until only smoke and embers remained. Such was the demons\' fury that even the nearby columns and statues were reduced to rubble and ash. An acceptable sacrifice on the altar of progress, as far as Thal\'kiel was concerned. \r\n<BR/><BR/>But when he looked upon his colleagues\' faces, he didn\'t see the approval he expected. Kil\'jaeden\'s expression was remote, inscrutable, but there could be no doubt about how Velen felt. He condemned Thal\'kiel\'s new summonings and ordered him never to conjure them again.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Five</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe following is from an account of Thal\'kiel\'s last days, written by an anonymous Wakener. It was recovered from Archimonde\'s private archive.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"After Master Thal\'kiel\'s disastrous demonstration, Velen forbade him from conjuring demons, denouncing his \'new era\' as a failed experiment. Thal\'kiel withdrew to his chambers for weeks. He neither ate nor slept. His only companions were the demonic minions he would summon and then banish in rage, or so we guessed--all we could hear were the shrieks of imps as they were thrust back and forth between this realm and the Twisting Nether. We also sensed the presence of other, larger entities with him, shadowy apparitions of baleful influence, though his servants swore that no one had entered his sanctum.\r\n<BR/><BR/>"When finally Thal\'kiel emerged, he was changed. He had aged by centuries, alone in the dark with his thoughts and his thralls. His back was twisted and stooped, and there was an odd glimmer in his eye. He summoned his Wakeners, and we answered the call, for we loved him like a father.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"He looked at each of us in turn, and said only, \'The new era begins.\'"\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Six</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThal\'kiel commanded his Wakeners to continue their experiments in summoning fel creatures. In secret, he and his sorcerers conjured demons of increasingly dire aspect, and they cast powerful spells to hide their minions in covert training grounds. Shielded from the eyes of Velen and Kil\'jaeden, Thal\'kiel slowly amassed a great demonic army with one purpose: to install him as dictator of Argus.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe Wakeners were united behind Thal\'kiel, save one--his apprentice, Archimonde. Although he had no aversion to demons-in fact, he rather enjoyed them--Archimonde was driven by ambition, and he was eager to prove himself to Velen and Kil\'jaeden. The night before the Wakeners were to stage their coup, Archimonde revealed Thal\'kiel\'s plans to the rulers of the eredar.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"You shall have his head for this," Archimonde said.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Seven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nVelen and Kil\'jaeden were stunned to learn of Thal\'kiel\'s treachery. He had summoned legions of fel beasts to build his personal empire, plotting to assassinate the eredar rulers. He had tapped into a strange new source of power whose limits were unknown, and he needed to be stopped, swiftly and without mercy. To prove his loyalty to Velen and Kil\'jaeden, Archimonde broke the wards that hid where Thal\'kiel\'s demonic army was marshaled, and he led a contingent of magi in storming the secret training grounds.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe battle did not last long. Caught off guard, the Wakeners were easily defeated by the invading magi, and without commanders to direct them, the demons were slaughtered. Archimonde himself confronted his master as he was summoning reinforcements. With a single stroke of his blade, he decapitated Thal\'kiel.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Eight</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nFrom chapter one of A Treatise on Eredar Phrenology:\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"The science of phrenology--the study of skull shape as a means to determine intellectual aptitude--became popular in Argus around the time of the Second Duumvirate. Its proponents believed that an eredar\'s mental faculties, such as willpower, memory, and perception, could be attributed to the shape and size of various protuberances on that individual\'s skull. Some theorized that if an eredar\'s skull was sufficiently well-proportioned for spellcasting, it could be utilized to channel magical energies even after death. This practice was deemed too barbaric to be put into common use, though it was not unheard of. \r\n<BR/><BR/>"Among the most prominent phrenologists during this period were Thal\'kiel and Archimonde. Thal\'kiel in particular was noted for having the archetypal sorcerer\'s skull, for which he was widely admired."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Nine</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAfter they crushed Thal\'kiel\'s rebellion, the eredar rulers\' magi burned the Wakeners\' bodies so their fel taint would not spread, and they destroyed the rebels\' writings to suppress the knowledge of their foul arts. Archimonde oversaw the effort, and when it was done, he was hailed as a hero. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSoon afterward, Archimonde commissioned one of Argus\'s finest jewelers to gild Thal\'kiel\'s skull. He claimed that he was preparing it for viewing--as a grim warning not to follow Thal\'kiel\'s path. In truth, he had it adorned with metals that would enhance its ability to channel magical energy, the perfect decoration for the perfect sorcerer\'s skull, which Archimonde proudly displayed in his domicile.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Ten</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nArchimonde eventually rose to lead the eredar alongside Velen and Kil\'jaeden, and by all accounts, he was a wise and sagacious ruler. In actuality, however, a demonic presence had been slowly infiltrating Archimonde\'s mind, using Thal\'kiel\'s skull as a conduit for its pernicious influence. While Archimonde slept, he saw visions of civilizations consumed in magnificent fel fire, and a dark god standing at the head of a glorious army. The entity whispered promises of strength that were impossible for mere mortals to comprehend, and Archimonde drank them in, eager to learn more of this mysterious being and his invincible legions.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThus when the Dark Titan, Sargeras, finally came to Argus and offered the eredar a place in his kingdom, Archimonde was the first to accept.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Eleven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAfter Archimonde became one of the Burning Legion\'s generals, he put Thal\'kiel\'s skull to good use. In life, Thal\'kiel had been unmatched in his ability to control demonic minions, and his skull was no less adept. World after world fell before Archimonde as he channeled his commands through the skull, compelling multitudes of demons to obey, his forces obliterating opponents with the grace and precision of an expertly choreographed ballet.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSince then, possession of Thal\'kiel\'s skull has passed between a handful of Sargeras\'s elite generals, with preference given to those who lead invasions of the fallen titan\'s most sought-after worlds. The dreadlord Mephistroth, commander of the Legion\'s vanguard in Azeroth, was the last to be seen with it.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part One</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nDuring the War of the Ancients, the night elf queen Azshara and her Highborne sorcerers attempted to open a portal that would allow Sargeras into Azeroth. The challenge was unprecedented; never before had anyone built a gateway that was strong enough for a titan. For weeks the Highborne labored without rest, crafting and weaving spells to devise a passage through the night elves\' colossal fount of power, the Well of Eternity. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut just as Sargeras was about to emerge into the world, the night elf resistance disrupted the Highborne\'s spellwork and demolished the Well of Eternity. Sargeras was cast back into the Twisting Nether, his ambition denied, his greatest chance to conquer Azeroth slipping from his grasp. The Dark Titan swore revenge. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nHe would tear down the walls between himself and his prize.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Two</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAfter his defeat at the Well of Eternity, Sargeras immediately planned his next method of infiltrating Azeroth. He knew he couldn\'t rely on a static portal; to serve a titan, such a gateway required an astronomical amount of power, and the most promising source had been destroyed in his last attempt. Moreover, the Highborne\'s laborious preparation and spellwork had given away his intentions, which had allowed the night elf resistance to thwart him. If he wanted to overcome Azeroth\'s defenders, Sargeras needed to enter the world with minimal warning. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Thus he commanded the eredar to forge a tool that would wrench open rifts between worlds for only a short time, just long enough to let a portion of his soul through. Although that meant he couldn\'t enter Azeroth in his most devastating form, such an instrument would clear a path for his avatar to lead the Legion\'s invasion or carry out subtler schemes.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSuch an instrument would also weaken the integrity of the physical universe and threaten to collapse it, but Sargeras considered those to be only side benefits. \r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Three</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nMillennia ago, Sargeras ordered his most talented eredar sorcerers to construct him a cosmic battering ram. They did not disappoint. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nFirst, scores of magi conducted dark rituals to channel countless portals into a single staff. They then projected the empowered artifact into every corner of the Great Dark Beyond, weaving it into the fabric of reality, creating a thread that could be pulled to unravel the seams of the physical universe at will. To fuel this monstrous undertaking, a hundred warlocks sacrificed a hundred demons, selecting them from among the Legion troops that had been part of the failed invasion of Azeroth. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThus was forged the Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras. Thus was born Azeroth\'s doom. \r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Four</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe Scepter of Sargeras is known for the gleaming jewel that adorns its apex. Many theorize that it represents Sargeras\'s baleful eye, which caught only a glimpse of Azeroth before the fallen titan was ripped back to the Twisting Nether. But the truth is far different. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSoon after the War of the Ancients, Sargeras had a vision: the Well of Eternity imploded once again, but this time, it dragged him down to the very core of Azeroth. He was there for only an instant, but in that moment, he saw Azeroth\'s slumbering world-soul--and in that moment, the world-soul opened one eye and gazed at the Dark Titan. He was enraptured. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Since then, the eye of Azeroth\'s world-soul has not been far from his thoughts. He commanded the eredar who forged the scepter to crown it with that lone, wondrous orb. Next to it, the eredar placed two nathrezim wings, a testament to Sargeras\'s conception of the world-soul: corrupted, demonic, and most importantly, his.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Five</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe Scepter of Sargeras was a marvel of arcane and fel sorcery, an instrument fit for a titan. It could lacerate the connective tissue of the physical universe, opening portals to any realm Sargeras desired, yet the rifts it created would allow only a portion of his soul to enter. It was a minor setback. Sargeras would simply have to be more inventive with his plans. And so, he waited.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nMillennia later, Sargeras saw his opportunity. The Guardian Aegwynn had become the most powerful mage on Azeroth, and not even the Council of Tirisfal could control her. Her pride made her a fine candidate for corruption. Sargeras could not infiltrate Azeroth in his most lethal form, but perhaps he could use the rebellious Guardian as a vessel for his machinations.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

My mouth went dry, and the hairs on my neck bristled, responding to stimuli that my mortal senses could not comprehend. It was like the coming of a monstrous storm, right before the thunderheads would unleash their cataclysmic onslaught. Yet the air remained as still as great Galakrond\'s bones. Something was wrong, very wrong, and all we could do was wait.\r\n<BR/><BR/>"I\'ll always remember the sound. That slippery, hollow, CRACKING sound, like that of a mace splitting a giant\'s skull. But it was bigger than that-louder, longer. It pierced me like an arrow through my chest, though I knew the breach had happened some distance away. The edges of the world seemed to quiver, and for an instant I thought they might collapse. But they did not. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"That was when the avatar of Sargeras entered the field of battle."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

His avatar was but a pale shadow of his true form, but that hardly mattered. After all, even if he couldn\'t defeat Aegwynn, he could still use her for his own ends. He had only to weaken her defenses, to create an opening for a shard of his spirit to break through. Just as he\'d infiltrated Azeroth with the scepter, so too would he invade Aegwynn\'s soul, corrupting it into another instrument of the Legion. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Afterward, Aegwynn would remember the battle as the most brutal she\'d ever fought, but she finally destroyed the avatar of Sargeras in an avalanche of arcane might. As she stood triumphant over her fallen foe, she could scarcely believe that she had won. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nLittle did she know that she had lost.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Eight</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nFrom the journal of Aegwynn, Guardian of Tirisfal:\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"I have defeated the avatar of the Great Enemy, Sargeras, but I cannot enjoy my victory. There is a hollowness inside my breast, a persistent ache from a wound whose origin I do not know. It must be from the strain of the battle.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"I will dispose of the remnants of the fallen titan\'s incursion. His avatar, though but a fragment of his full form, rivals Galakrond in stature, and I cannot let his bones take up residence next to the gargantuan proto-dragon\'s. Who knows what foul taint lies in wait to be released? Even in death, the corpse is malevolent, gripping its cursed scepter as if it still intends to rule. \r\n<BR/><BR/>"The scepter. No one must be allowed to wield it. This was the instrument Sargeras used to enter Azeroth, tearing a gash in the universe that threatened to obliterate our world. The eye on top of the staff stares out, mocking me. I shall ensure that it never sees the light of day again."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Nine</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAfter Aegwynn defeated Sargeras\'s avatar, she interred his corpse in the ruins of Suramar, along with the artifacts that he bore. Deep beneath the sea, shielded by enchanted Highborne seals, the Scepter of Sargeras remained for centuries, its power undiminished. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSargeras attempted to regain control of the staff through Aegwynn, but the task proved more difficult than he had estimated. He could sway the Guardian in many ways, but he could not compel her to exhume his scepter from its watery grave. Something held her back, a primal instinct louder than Sargeras\'s whispering. She knew the artifact was dangerous, that its use risked the destruction of all things. Even possessed by the Dark Titan, she would not yield. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Sargeras realized that greater subtlety was needed. Eventually, he extended his pernicious influence to Aegwynn\'s son, Medivh, as he developed in her womb. Through this new vessel, Sargeras planned to recover his beloved scepter. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nHad he succeeded, the world of Draenor might not have been annihilated.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Ten</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nOther than the Dark Titan, the Scepter of Sargeras has had few wielders. One of them was the orc warlock Ner\'zhul.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAfter the Horde\'s defeat in the Second War, Ner\'zhul sought to reinvigorate his followers by opening gateways to new worlds for them to conquer. To that end, he dispatched his servants to recover various artifacts from the Tomb of Sargeras, including the scepter, which the fallen titan had used to infiltrate Azeroth centuries before. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Ner\'zhul was not Sargeras, however, so he could not simply command the staff to open portals. He had to wait until the constellations of Draenor were properly aligned, and he could only use the scepter in conjunction with other artifacts. The warlock grew impatient, frustrated with his limitations. Intoxicated by the Skull of Gul\'dan\'s influence, he had visions of his erstwhile apprentice, who urged him to unleash his godlike powers. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nWhen at last the moment arrived for Ner\'zhul to act, he did so with wild abandon, heedless of the consequences. It mattered not to him if Draenor was destroyed; in fact, he welcomed it as part of his legacy. With the scepter, he blasted hole after hole through the fabric of reality, shredding the seams connecting Draenor to the rest of the physical universe. As he rushed headlong through one of the portals, he could hear the world shattering behind him.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Eleven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAfter Draenor was destroyed, the demon lord Kil\'jaeden wrested control of the Scepter of Sargeras from Ner\'zhul. At last, the artifact was back in the Legion\'s possession, and Kil\'jaeden would set about using it to invade Azeroth. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut he was not as powerful as Sargeras; he could not open a portal mighty enough even for his avatar. Thus he conspired with Kael\'thas Sunstrider to create a gateway through the Sunwell, the blood elves\' ruined fount of power. Combined with the world-rending force of the scepter, Kael\'thas\'s portal cleared the way for Kil\'jaeden\'s full form. \r\n<BR/><BR/>However, before the demon lord could set foot on Azeroth, Anveena, the embodiment of the Sunwell\'s energies, intervened. She sacrificed herself, unleashing all of her strength on the Deceiver and allowing him to be thrown back into the Twisting Nether-along with the Scepter of Sargeras. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe staff has not been seen on Azeroth since. A small comfort, for surely the Legion will use it to infiltrate the world once again. But no matter who wields it, the threat it poses is unspeakable. The destruction of Draenor is testament to the devastation that even mortals can wreak with this weapon.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

He gazed into the depths of the Great Dark Beyond and embraced that which gazed back. He saw worlds consumed by fel fire, dark creatures of the Twisting Nether overrunning mortal civilizations, the conquest of creation. Now all that remains of him is this skull, which lends the bearer his power to command demons. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nLike most skulls, Thal\'kiel\'s comes with a cautionary tale. Never mind that it\'s been heeded by none.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part One</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nBefore the coming of Sargeras to Argus, the eredar Thal\'kiel ushered in a golden age for his people. Thal\'kiel was a sorcerer of unparalleled talent, and he and his Wakeners pushed the limits of summoning and binding magics, conjuring the arcane entities that helped build the capital\'s wondrous architecture. Thal\'kiel also devised the machines that focused the world\'s latent arcane energy, suffusing Argus with peace, harmony, and vitality. All were in awe of his abilities, including his young apprentice, Archimonde. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThere were rumors that Archimonde coveted Thal\'kiel\'s power and influence, but the eredar leader dismissed these as pure fabrication, for his apprentice had shown him nothing but devotion. Archimonde had even gone to great lengths to commission a custom-made crown for Thal\'kiel, taking the measurements for his head himself.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Two</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThal\'kiel led an order of eredar magi called the Wakeners, specialists in the arts of conjuration and binding. They were renowned for their clever arcane constructs, exploring new frontiers in summoning. Yet Thal\'kiel was never one to rest on his laurels. He thirsted for more. Seeking to elevate his order to levels undreamed of, he searched uncharted terrain, venturing farther than any eredar had dared before. His spells plumbed the vastness of the Great Dark Beyond, petitioning for a deeper well of power.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nOne day, he received an answer.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Three</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThal\'kiel was brilliant, but he was not wise. A dark presence whispered to him, and the eredar\'s mind was consumed with visions of power beyond his wildest imaginings, of ranks upon ranks of deadly servants eager to obey his every whim. These demonic forces made Thal\'kiel\'s arcane constructs look like a child\'s playthings. Afterward, he would despise the arcane, his passion reserved only for fel magic. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThal\'kiel\'s mysterious benefactor bestowed upon him the ability to summon lesser demons, and the eredar immediately spread the knowledge to his Wakeners. Imps and felhounds, infernals and abyssals, all executed the commands of Thal\'kiel and his sorcerers. Convinced that this was the start of a new era, Thal\'kiel feverishly prepared to present his wondrous pets to the rulers of Argus, Velen and Kil\'jaeden.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBrilliant. Not wise.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Four</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nIn the presence of Velen, Kil\'jaeden, and the eredar rulers\' inner circle, the sorcerer Thal\'kiel demonstrated what his fel darlings could do. First, he summoned scores of his familiar arcane constructs and arrayed them in orderly rows. Then the sky went dark, and the clouds roiled as a storm of meteors crashed down. From the craters emerged an army of infernals--which Thal\'kiel unleashed on the constructs. It was a symbolic display of the new era he saw for his people. He watched rapturously as the demons obliterated the unfortunate arcane entities, smashing and burning them until only smoke and embers remained. Such was the demons\' fury that even the nearby columns and statues were reduced to rubble and ash. An acceptable sacrifice on the altar of progress, as far as Thal\'kiel was concerned. \r\n<BR/><BR/>But when he looked upon his colleagues\' faces, he didn\'t see the approval he expected. Kil\'jaeden\'s expression was remote, inscrutable, but there could be no doubt about how Velen felt. He condemned Thal\'kiel\'s new summonings and ordered him never to conjure them again.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Five</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe following is from an account of Thal\'kiel\'s last days, written by an anonymous Wakener. It was recovered from Archimonde\'s private archive.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"After Master Thal\'kiel\'s disastrous demonstration, Velen forbade him from conjuring demons, denouncing his \'new era\' as a failed experiment. Thal\'kiel withdrew to his chambers for weeks. He neither ate nor slept. His only companions were the demonic minions he would summon and then banish in rage, or so we guessed--all we could hear were the shrieks of imps as they were thrust back and forth between this realm and the Twisting Nether. We also sensed the presence of other, larger entities with him, shadowy apparitions of baleful influence, though his servants swore that no one had entered his sanctum.\r\n<BR/><BR/>"When finally Thal\'kiel emerged, he was changed. He had aged by centuries, alone in the dark with his thoughts and his thralls. His back was twisted and stooped, and there was an odd glimmer in his eye. He summoned his Wakeners, and we answered the call, for we loved him like a father.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"He looked at each of us in turn, and said only, \'The new era begins.\'"\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Six</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThal\'kiel commanded his Wakeners to continue their experiments in summoning fel creatures. In secret, he and his sorcerers conjured demons of increasingly dire aspect, and they cast powerful spells to hide their minions in covert training grounds. Shielded from the eyes of Velen and Kil\'jaeden, Thal\'kiel slowly amassed a great demonic army with one purpose: to install him as dictator of Argus.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe Wakeners were united behind Thal\'kiel, save one--his apprentice, Archimonde. Although he had no aversion to demons-in fact, he rather enjoyed them--Archimonde was driven by ambition, and he was eager to prove himself to Velen and Kil\'jaeden. The night before the Wakeners were to stage their coup, Archimonde revealed Thal\'kiel\'s plans to the rulers of the eredar.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"You shall have his head for this," Archimonde said.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Seven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nVelen and Kil\'jaeden were stunned to learn of Thal\'kiel\'s treachery. He had summoned legions of fel beasts to build his personal empire, plotting to assassinate the eredar rulers. He had tapped into a strange new source of power whose limits were unknown, and he needed to be stopped, swiftly and without mercy. To prove his loyalty to Velen and Kil\'jaeden, Archimonde broke the wards that hid where Thal\'kiel\'s demonic army was marshaled, and he led a contingent of magi in storming the secret training grounds.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe battle did not last long. Caught off guard, the Wakeners were easily defeated by the invading magi, and without commanders to direct them, the demons were slaughtered. Archimonde himself confronted his master as he was summoning reinforcements. With a single stroke of his blade, he decapitated Thal\'kiel.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Eight</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nFrom chapter one of A Treatise on Eredar Phrenology:\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"The science of phrenology--the study of skull shape as a means to determine intellectual aptitude--became popular in Argus around the time of the Second Duumvirate. Its proponents believed that an eredar\'s mental faculties, such as willpower, memory, and perception, could be attributed to the shape and size of various protuberances on that individual\'s skull. Some theorized that if an eredar\'s skull was sufficiently well-proportioned for spellcasting, it could be utilized to channel magical energies even after death. This practice was deemed too barbaric to be put into common use, though it was not unheard of. \r\n<BR/><BR/>"Among the most prominent phrenologists during this period were Thal\'kiel and Archimonde. Thal\'kiel in particular was noted for having the archetypal sorcerer\'s skull, for which he was widely admired."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Nine</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAfter they crushed Thal\'kiel\'s rebellion, the eredar rulers\' magi burned the Wakeners\' bodies so their fel taint would not spread, and they destroyed the rebels\' writings to suppress the knowledge of their foul arts. Archimonde oversaw the effort, and when it was done, he was hailed as a hero. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSoon afterward, Archimonde commissioned one of Argus\'s finest jewelers to gild Thal\'kiel\'s skull. He claimed that he was preparing it for viewing--as a grim warning not to follow Thal\'kiel\'s path. In truth, he had it adorned with metals that would enhance its ability to channel magical energy, the perfect decoration for the perfect sorcerer\'s skull, which Archimonde proudly displayed in his domicile.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Ten</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nArchimonde eventually rose to lead the eredar alongside Velen and Kil\'jaeden, and by all accounts, he was a wise and sagacious ruler. In actuality, however, a demonic presence had been slowly infiltrating Archimonde\'s mind, using Thal\'kiel\'s skull as a conduit for its pernicious influence. While Archimonde slept, he saw visions of civilizations consumed in magnificent fel fire, and a dark god standing at the head of a glorious army. The entity whispered promises of strength that were impossible for mere mortals to comprehend, and Archimonde drank them in, eager to learn more of this mysterious being and his invincible legions.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThus when the Dark Titan, Sargeras, finally came to Argus and offered the eredar a place in his kingdom, Archimonde was the first to accept.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Eleven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAfter Archimonde became one of the Burning Legion\'s generals, he put Thal\'kiel\'s skull to good use. In life, Thal\'kiel had been unmatched in his ability to control demonic minions, and his skull was no less adept. World after world fell before Archimonde as he channeled his commands through the skull, compelling multitudes of demons to obey, his forces obliterating opponents with the grace and precision of an expertly choreographed ballet.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSince then, possession of Thal\'kiel\'s skull has passed between a handful of Sargeras\'s elite generals, with preference given to those who lead invasions of the fallen titan\'s most sought-after worlds. The dreadlord Mephistroth, commander of the Legion\'s vanguard in Azeroth, was the last to be seen with it.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

It was forged on the orders of Sargeras after his defeat in the War of the Ancients, intended as a means to conquer Azeroth once and for all. This scepter rips open the fabric of reality, obliterating the barriers between worlds, destroying everything that stands between you and your goal. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIf you\'re lucky, that\'s all the damage it will do.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part One</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nDuring the War of the Ancients, the night elf queen Azshara and her Highborne sorcerers attempted to open a portal that would allow Sargeras into Azeroth. The challenge was unprecedented; never before had anyone built a gateway that was strong enough for a titan. For weeks the Highborne labored without rest, crafting and weaving spells to devise a passage through the night elves\' colossal fount of power, the Well of Eternity. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut just as Sargeras was about to emerge into the world, the night elf resistance disrupted the Highborne\'s spellwork and demolished the Well of Eternity. Sargeras was cast back into the Twisting Nether, his ambition denied, his greatest chance to conquer Azeroth slipping from his grasp. The Dark Titan swore revenge. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nHe would tear down the walls between himself and his prize.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Two</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAfter his defeat at the Well of Eternity, Sargeras immediately planned his next method of infiltrating Azeroth. He knew he couldn\'t rely on a static portal; to serve a titan, such a gateway required an astronomical amount of power, and the most promising source had been destroyed in his last attempt. Moreover, the Highborne\'s laborious preparation and spellwork had given away his intentions, which had allowed the night elf resistance to thwart him. If he wanted to overcome Azeroth\'s defenders, Sargeras needed to enter the world with minimal warning. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Thus he commanded the eredar to forge a tool that would wrench open rifts between worlds for only a short time, just long enough to let a portion of his soul through. Although that meant he couldn\'t enter Azeroth in his most devastating form, such an instrument would clear a path for his avatar to lead the Legion\'s invasion or carry out subtler schemes.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSuch an instrument would also weaken the integrity of the physical universe and threaten to collapse it, but Sargeras considered those to be only side benefits. \r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Three</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nMillennia ago, Sargeras ordered his most talented eredar sorcerers to construct him a cosmic battering ram. They did not disappoint. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nFirst, scores of magi conducted dark rituals to channel countless portals into a single staff. They then projected the empowered artifact into every corner of the Great Dark Beyond, weaving it into the fabric of reality, creating a thread that could be pulled to unravel the seams of the physical universe at will. To fuel this monstrous undertaking, a hundred warlocks sacrificed a hundred demons, selecting them from among the Legion troops that had been part of the failed invasion of Azeroth. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThus was forged the Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras. Thus was born Azeroth\'s doom. \r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Four</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe Scepter of Sargeras is known for the gleaming jewel that adorns its apex. Many theorize that it represents Sargeras\'s baleful eye, which caught only a glimpse of Azeroth before the fallen titan was ripped back to the Twisting Nether. But the truth is far different. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSoon after the War of the Ancients, Sargeras had a vision: the Well of Eternity imploded once again, but this time, it dragged him down to the very core of Azeroth. He was there for only an instant, but in that moment, he saw Azeroth\'s slumbering world-soul--and in that moment, the world-soul opened one eye and gazed at the Dark Titan. He was enraptured. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Since then, the eye of Azeroth\'s world-soul has not been far from his thoughts. He commanded the eredar who forged the scepter to crown it with that lone, wondrous orb. Next to it, the eredar placed two nathrezim wings, a testament to Sargeras\'s conception of the world-soul: corrupted, demonic, and most importantly, his.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Five</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe Scepter of Sargeras was a marvel of arcane and fel sorcery, an instrument fit for a titan. It could lacerate the connective tissue of the physical universe, opening portals to any realm Sargeras desired, yet the rifts it created would allow only a portion of his soul to enter. It was a minor setback. Sargeras would simply have to be more inventive with his plans. And so, he waited.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nMillennia later, Sargeras saw his opportunity. The Guardian Aegwynn had become the most powerful mage on Azeroth, and not even the Council of Tirisfal could control her. Her pride made her a fine candidate for corruption. Sargeras could not infiltrate Azeroth in his most lethal form, but perhaps he could use the rebellious Guardian as a vessel for his machinations.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Six</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nFrom the journal of Aegwynn, Guardian of Tirisfal:\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"We had finished routing the Legion\'s minions when the sky turned black. My mouth went dry, and the hairs on my neck bristled, responding to stimuli that my mortal senses could not comprehend. It was like the coming of a monstrous storm, right before the thunderheads would unleash their cataclysmic onslaught. Yet the air remained as still as great Galakrond\'s bones. Something was wrong, very wrong, and all we could do was wait.\r\n<BR/><BR/>"I\'ll always remember the sound. That slippery, hollow, CRACKING sound, like that of a mace splitting a giant\'s skull. But it was bigger than that-louder, longer. It pierced me like an arrow through my chest, though I knew the breach had happened some distance away. The edges of the world seemed to quiver, and for an instant I thought they might collapse. But they did not. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"That was when the avatar of Sargeras entered the field of battle."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

His avatar was but a pale shadow of his true form, but that hardly mattered. After all, even if he couldn\'t defeat Aegwynn, he could still use her for his own ends. He had only to weaken her defenses, to create an opening for a shard of his spirit to break through. Just as he\'d infiltrated Azeroth with the scepter, so too would he invade Aegwynn\'s soul, corrupting it into another instrument of the Legion. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Afterward, Aegwynn would remember the battle as the most brutal she\'d ever fought, but she finally destroyed the avatar of Sargeras in an avalanche of arcane might. As she stood triumphant over her fallen foe, she could scarcely believe that she had won. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nLittle did she know that she had lost.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

There is a hollowness inside my breast, a persistent ache from a wound whose origin I do not know. It must be from the strain of the battle.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"I will dispose of the remnants of the fallen titan\'s incursion. His avatar, though but a fragment of his full form, rivals Galakrond in stature, and I cannot let his bones take up residence next to the gargantuan proto-dragon\'s. Who knows what foul taint lies in wait to be released? Even in death, the corpse is malevolent, gripping its cursed scepter as if it still intends to rule. \r\n<BR/><BR/>"The scepter. No one must be allowed to wield it. This was the instrument Sargeras used to enter Azeroth, tearing a gash in the universe that threatened to obliterate our world.

Deep beneath the sea, shielded by enchanted Highborne seals, the Scepter of Sargeras remained for centuries, its power undiminished. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSargeras attempted to regain control of the staff through Aegwynn, but the task proved more difficult than he had estimated. He could sway the Guardian in many ways, but he could not compel her to exhume his scepter from its watery grave. Something held her back, a primal instinct louder than Sargeras\'s whispering. She knew the artifact was dangerous, that its use risked the destruction of all things. Even possessed by the Dark Titan, she would not yield. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Sargeras realized that greater subtlety was needed. Eventually, he extended his pernicious influence to Aegwynn\'s son, Medivh, as he developed in her womb. Through this new vessel, Sargeras planned to recover his beloved scepter. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nHad he succeeded, the world of Draenor might not have been annihilated.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Ten</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nOther than the Dark Titan, the Scepter of Sargeras has had few wielders. One of them was the orc warlock Ner\'zhul.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAfter the Horde\'s defeat in the Second War, Ner\'zhul sought to reinvigorate his followers by opening gateways to new worlds for them to conquer. To that end, he dispatched his servants to recover various artifacts from the Tomb of Sargeras, including the scepter, which the fallen titan had used to infiltrate Azeroth centuries before. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Ner\'zhul was not Sargeras, however, so he could not simply command the staff to open portals. He had to wait until the constellations of Draenor were properly aligned, and he could only use the scepter in conjunction with other artifacts. The warlock grew impatient, frustrated with his limitations. Intoxicated by the Skull of Gul\'dan\'s influence, he had visions of his erstwhile apprentice, who urged him to unleash his godlike powers. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nWhen at last the moment arrived for Ner\'zhul to act, he did so with wild abandon, heedless of the consequences. It mattered not to him if Draenor was destroyed; in fact, he welcomed it as part of his legacy. With the scepter, he blasted hole after hole through the fabric of reality, shredding the seams connecting Draenor to the rest of the physical universe. As he rushed headlong through one of the portals, he could hear the world shattering behind him.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Eleven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAfter Draenor was destroyed, the demon lord Kil\'jaeden wrested control of the Scepter of Sargeras from Ner\'zhul. At last, the artifact was back in the Legion\'s possession, and Kil\'jaeden would set about using it to invade Azeroth. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut he was not as powerful as Sargeras; he could not open a portal mighty enough even for his avatar. Thus he conspired with Kael\'thas Sunstrider to create a gateway through the Sunwell, the blood elves\' ruined fount of power. Combined with the world-rending force of the scepter, Kael\'thas\'s portal cleared the way for Kil\'jaeden\'s full form. \r\n<BR/><BR/>However, before the demon lord could set foot on Azeroth, Anveena, the embodiment of the Sunwell\'s energies, intervened. She sacrificed herself, unleashing all of her strength on the Deceiver and allowing him to be thrown back into the Twisting Nether-along with the Scepter of Sargeras. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe staff has not been seen on Azeroth since. A small comfort, for surely the Legion will use it to infiltrate the world once again. But no matter who wields it, the threat it poses is unspeakable. The destruction of Draenor is testament to the devastation that even mortals can wreak with this weapon.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

So our council of six warlocks gathered to discuss how best to investigate the new magics witnessed by these threats.",
					'At first, the six of us refused to cooperate, tossing blame and bickering as easily as shadowbolts and curses. Finally, after several nights, the human Kanrethad spoke out:\n\n"In the wake of the Cataclysm, the rising tensions between the Horde and Alliance have driven the greatest heroes of Azeroth to train for war. Warriors have readied their war banners, the Death Knights of Acherus have learned to control the undead and it is even said the Mages are researching ways to undo time itself."\n\n"The relentless darkness which bathed Azeroth has been pushed back. Cho\'gall is slain and the remnants of the Twilight\'s Hammer cult have been scattered. Ragnaros is defeated and his armies forced back into the Firelands. Deathwing lies torn apart and his Twilight drakes obliterated. However, the powers they commanded are not so easily forgotten... powers untapped and ripe for the taking."',
					'"In fact, among us now stands several who have faced their power firsthand," he said, pointing at a hooded figure across the room. A deep, sinister laugh echoed from the hood as it burst into flames and burned away to reveal the orc enchanter, Ritssyn.\n\n"It is true, pink skin, I was there when the Firelord was vanquished. The intensity of his flame was unlike anything you can imagine." The burning glow of Ritssyn\'s eyes cast eerie shadows over his burn-scarred face and thick-tusked grin.\n\n"Untrue," spat a sharp, feminine voice.  Shinfel, a Blood Elf adorned with sharp spikes of Twilight elementium, glared across the table, "Until you\'ve been a prisoner within your own mind, you know nothing of horror." Shinfel\'s blood had been corrupted during the fight with Cho\'gall and her arms were now covered in black marks left behind by the corruption that had erupted from her skin.  The experience had only served to increase the intensity of her sadism.',
					'Shinfel continued, "Even the Firelord\'s flames were overshadowed by the raw chaos unleashed by the Destroyer."  She paused a moment and glanced to the worgen who remained eerily silent. Zinnin had been present when Deathwing was unmade and had not spoken a word since. Zinnin\'s eyes narrowed for a moment, then snarled at Ritssyn. \r\n\r\nKanrethad stood up from the table and took a deep breath. "This is exactly why we are here. I have no love for any of you, but we each bore witness to pieces of even greater power. Imagine - if we fused the molten fury of the Firelands with the unstoppable chaos of Deathwing. Even the powers of the Burning Legion could not hold a candle to our flames!"',
					'Ritssyn kicked his boots upon the table and snickered, "And just who would do this? You?" he spat. "I think not. You haven\'t been seen in battle since the siege of the Black Temple. If it weren\'t for having shared the secrets of Illidan\'s transformation with this council, I would kill you just for having the audacity of summoning me."\r\n\r\nKanrethad\'s lips pursed for a moment, but he relaxed and continued. "No. The scope of this task exceeds the capabilities of any single member here. I propose this council split into pairs. Ritssyn and Zinnin would lead a group into Sulfuras. Similarly, Shinfel and Zelifrax would hunt down the remaining members of the Twilight\'s Hammer cult and ... persuade them to share what they learned."',
					'The pock-faced gnome applauded with mirthful glee.\n\nKanrethad continued, "Then we return... one year from now and take the results of our expeditions back to our own sects, more powerful than we would have been alone."\n\nRitssyn frowned as he saw the greed drawn out in the human\'s words dance across the council\'s faces.  "And what would keep us from simply killing our partner in their sleep once it was a success?"\n\nKanrethad\'s brow furrowed and he growled, "Which is why we swear that if any member of this council breaks the contract and fails to return or returns alone, the others shall strike them down and banish their soul forever. We either succeed together or die alone."',
					'Ritssyn was a powerful warlock, and could probably defeat Kanrethad by himself. But against all five of us? We all saw his hesitation. We all let our hands drift toward our scrolls and weapons.\n\n"Fine," Ritssyn reluctantly agreed. "I can play along with your fool\'s errand, but first I must know, where will you and that miserable forsaken, Jubeka, be going?"\n\n"Me?" spoke Kanrethad with a wicked grin.  "Why I\'m returning... to Outland."',

In that age, there were many dragonflights. ",

The greatest members of the Pantheon imbued a portion of their power upon each of the flights' leaders. These majestic dragons (as listed below) became known as the Great Aspects, or the Dragon Aspects. ",

The Highfather empowered Nozdormu to guard time itself and police the ever-spinning pathways of fate and destiny. The stoic, honorable Nozdormu became known as the Timeless One.",

Ever after, Alexstrasza would be known as the Life-Binder, and she would work to safeguard all living creatures within the world. Due to her supreme wisdom and limitless compassion for all living things, Alexstrasza was crowned the Dragonqueen and given dominion over her kind.",

The great-hearted Neltharion, known afterwards as the Earth-Warder, was given dominion over the earth and the deep places of the world. He embodied the strength of the world and served as Alexstrasza's greatest supporter.",

					'Lothar\'s Landing\r\n\r\nDuke Lothar annexed the island of New Light, sparking an economic boom in the empire. "Lothar\'s Landing" became an idiom for hopeful but uncertain trade or diplomatic initiatives by the empire. Often said with dripping sarcasm when the venture fails to find success.',
					'Dunelle\'s Kindness\r\n\r\nFrom Mereldar\'s Letters, "Dunelle\'s Kindness" is an idiom for a kind merchant. Dunelle\'s generosity symbolized a prosperous town.\r\n\r\n"A table of fruit awaited all travelers, not for sale but to relieve their woes. Dunelle\'s kindness was genuine, a gentle tide that lifted all spirits and ships in the city."',
					'Tenir\'s Ascent\r\n\r\nTenir, a character in an otherwise unremarkable play, became a common trope and then an idiom for victory, especially in risky adventures. Tenir\'s Ascent is a saying that has come to mean victory, specifically an armada victory, or one that involves a risky and perilous adventure. \r\n\r\n"My heart was buoyed with joy as I witnessed Tenir\'s ascent into the light streaked sky. I knew my love would return to me, and the emperor\'s armies would prove victorious."',
					'The Aegis Wall\r\n\r\nThis is a term referring to a magic shield from the old world, and to a sword and pike military maneuver named after it. Popularized from a manual of warfare from the reign of Emperor Laenz IV that described and promoted this tactic. Only after the Air Navy shifted combat to the skies was this tactic abandoned.\r\n \r\n"The spears broke from the weight of the bodies, but the Aegis Wall, like the shield of Thoradin, held."',
					'Lightspark\r\n\r\nThe Church of the Sacred Flame is one that reveres the radiant glow that is a merger of light and fire. "Lightspark" is one of many words found in Arathi speech and literature that are used to indicate a positive or desirable occurrence. A portmanteau of that means something akin to "The beginning of our victory".',
					'Lorel\'s Crossing\r\n\r\nThis is based on an old Arathi fairy tale about a young woman whose town on the frontier fell to raiders. Lorel is a young craftsperson who uses her skills to outwit various dangers as much as she uses her military training. This specific idiom refers to crossing a natural barrier to find a place of safety where one could settle and work.\r\n \r\n"Lorel\'s crossing of the river Aelrea left the wolves snapping not at her heels, but at each other\'s tails."\r\n\r\nLorel has become a popular name among Arathi in the northwest provinces.',

Medivh told the Horde and the Alliance of the dangers they faced and urged them to band together. ",

Thrall's greatest lieutenant, Grom Hellscream, even betrayed the Horde by giving himself over to his baser instincts.",

Certain that the orcs had returned to their warlike ways, the demigod Cenarius came forth to drive Hellscream and his orcs back. Yet Hellscream and his orcs, overcome with supernatural hate and rage, managed to kill Cenarius and corrupt the ancient forestlands. ",

Convinced that Illidan would aid them against the Legion, Tyrande set him free. Though Illidan did aid them for a time, he eventually fled to pursue his own interests.",

With little effort, he enslaved the minds of many indigenous creatures, including ice trolls and fierce wendigo, and he drew their evil brethren into his growing shadow.

After every victory, the Arathi offered peace and equality to the conquered people; thus, they won the loyalty of those they had beaten. Eventually the Arathi tribe came to include many disparate tribes, and the ranks of its army grew vast. ",

The city-state, named Strom, became the capital of the Arathi nation, Arathor. As Arathor prospered, humans from all over the vast continent traveled south to the protection and safety of Strom.",

One hundred men were taught the very basics of the elves' magical secrets: no more than was absolutely necessary to combat the trolls. Convinced that their human students were ready to aid in the struggle, the elves left Strom and traveled north alongside the mighty armies of King Thoradin. ",

A thin misting fog had begun to coat the rolling green hills of the valley below with dew, and the spire of the Imperial Granary stood out as a dark shadow against the brilliant canvas of stars overhead.\n\nAn evening of good food and many hours smoking the native herbs had put the two friends in a contemplative mood.\n\nZhi - the younger and more tightly wound of the two companions - suddenly asked a very pointed question: "What if none of this is real?"',
					'His old friend Ri, who until now had been leaning back with his hat over his eyes, lifted up the straw brim to peer at his friend. "A serious question?" he said, his brown eyes gleaming intently.\n\nZhi swept his arm over the horizon, indicating the whole of the valley. "What if we are just images, drawn into someone\'s painting?" he asked. He touched the side of his face, gasping. "What if we are characters in a book!?"\n\nOld Ri hugged his belly with both hands and bellowed a deep, contemplative laugh. He took the smoking pipe from his friend Zhi and set it aside.',
					'"Behind the eyes sits a person\'s soul," Old Ri answered at last. "Their essence: the thinking, loving, emotional core of being. My soul makes me real, as does yours."\n\nAnd now Old Ri rose to stand beside his friend. He put his arm around Zhi\'s shoulder and drew his attention to the valley below. "See there below us, to our right? The farmer\'s market?" In the cool autumn darkness, the Halfhill Market was like an island of warm yellow light amongst the dark undulating hills. Colorful flags rippled in the chill breeze, and figures could be seen moving amongst the stalls, buying supplies or bartering the fruits of their labor. The sound of their voices and laughter, indistinguishable from one another but unmistakably alive, could be heard all the way to the inn.',
					'"Those figures moving about, each of them has a soul," Old Ri continued. "And together, we share this space. Millions of souls, sharing one place together. Our place! Halfhill is real, so long as you and I are here together to enjoy it." Satisfied, Old Ri returned to his seat and motioned to the innkeeper for another drink.\n\nZhi lingered at the edge of the patio, resting his weight against the rough timber of a pillar. He breathed in the cool air, and watched fireflies dart amongst the waving starlit grasses of the fields below. "Ri," he said at last. "Painting or no... if our souls are to share a place, I would share no other with you."',
					"Old Ri tipped his hat back over his eyes and answered with a warm rumble of agreement.\n\nThe sound of crickets mixed with the lively bustle of the market below lulled the two friends back into a blissful silence.",

This portal bridged the distance between Azeroth and Draenor, and it was large enough that armies might pass through it.

King Llane, who believed the bestial orcs to be incapable of conquering Azeroth, contemptuously held his position at his capital of Stormwind. However, Sir Lothar became convinced that the battle should be taken directly to the enemy, and he was forced to choose between his convictions and his loyalty to the king. ",

Deciding, at last, to undo their works throughout the universe, he resolved to form an unstoppable army that would set the physical universe aflame.",

These cunning creatures bowed before the dark Titan's vast rage and offered to serve him in whatever malicious ways they could. Seeking a way to lead and control his vast demonic army, Sargeras recruited (and subsequently corrupted) the ancient and intelligent race of the Eredar.

The dreadlords served as his personal agents throughout the universe, and they took pleasure in locating primitive races for their master to corrupt and bring into the fold. First amongst the dreadlords was Tichondrius the Darkener. Tichondrius served Kil'jaeden as the perfect soldier and agreed to bring Sargeras' burning will to all the dark corners of the universe.",

					"These younger magicians began to practice magic for personal gain rather than out of any responsibility towards their fellows. ",
					"As the empire grew and expanded into new lands, the young magicians also spread out into the southlands. Wielding their mystical powers, the magicians protected their brethren from the wild creatures of the land and made it possible for new city-states to be constructed in the wilderness. Yet, as their powers grew, the magicians became ever more conceited and isolated from the rest of society.",
					"The second Arathorian city-state of Dalaran was founded in the lands north of Strom. Many fledgling wizards left the restraining confines of Strom behind and traveled to Dalaran, where they hoped to use their new powers with greater freedom. These magicians used their skills to build up the enchanted spires of Dalaran and reveled in the pursuit of their studies. ",
					"The citizens of Dalaran tolerated the magicians' endeavors and built up a bustling economy under the protection of their magic-using defenders. Yet, as more and more magicians practiced their arts, the fabric of reality around Dalaran began to weaken and tear.",
					"The sinister agents of the Burning Legion, who had been banished when the Well of Eternity collapsed, were lured back into the world by the heedless spellcasting of the magicians of Dalaran. Though these relatively weak demons did not appear in force, they did sew considerable confusion and chaos within the streets of Dalaran. ",
					"Most of these demonic encounters were isolated events, and the ruling Magocrats did what they could to keep such events hidden from the public. The most powerful magicians were sent to capture the elusive demons, but they often found themselves hopelessly outmatched by the lone agents of the mighty Legion.",
					"After a few months the superstitious peasantry began to suspect that their sorcerous rulers were hiding something terrible from them. Rumors of revolution began to sweep through the streets of Dalaran as the paranoid citizenry questioned the motives and practices of the magicians they had once admired. The Magocrats, fearing that the peasants would revolt and that Strom would take action against them, turned to the only group they felt would understand their particular problem: the elves.",
					"Upon hearing the Magocrats' news of demonic activity in Dalaran, the elves quickly dispatched their mightiest wizards to the human lands. The elven wizards studied the energy currents in Dalaran and made detailed reports of all demonic activity that they beheld. They concluded that although there were only a few demons loose in the world, the Legion itself would remain a dire threat so long as humans continued to wield the forces of magic. ",
					"The Council of Silvermoon, which ruled over the elves of Quel'Thalas, entered into a secret pact with the Magocrat lords of Dalaran. The elves told the Magocrats about the history of ancient Kalimdor and of the Burning Legion, a history which still threatened the world. They informed the humans that so long as they used magic, they would need to protect their citizenry from the malicious agents of the Legion. ",
					"The Magocrats proposed the notion of empowering a single mortal champion who would utilize their powers in order to fight a never-ending secret war against the Legion. It was stressed that the majority of mankind could never know about the Guardians or the threat of the Legion for fear that they would riot in fear and paranoia. The elves agreed to the proposal and founded a secret society that would watch over the selection of the Guardian and help to stem the rise of chaos in the world.",
					"The society held its secret meetings in the shadowed Tirisfal Glades, where the high elves had first settled in Lordaeron. Thus, they named the secret sect the Guardians of Tirisfal. The mortal champions who were chosen to be Guardians were imbued with incredible powers of both elven and human magic. Though there would only ever be one Guardian at a time, they held such vast power that they could single-handedly fight back the Legion's agents wherever they were found in the world. ",
					"The Guardian power was so great that only the Council of Tirisfal was allowed to choose potential successors to the mantle of Guardianship. Whenever a Guardian grew too old, or wearied of the secret war against chaos, the Council chose a new champion, and under controlled conditions, formally channeled the Guardian power into its new agent.",
					"As the generations passed, Guardians defended the masses of humanity from the invisible threat of the Burning Legion throughout the lands of Arathor and Quel'Thalas. Arathor grew and prospered while the use of magic spread throughout the empire. Meanwhile, the Guardians kept careful watch for signs of demonic activity. ",

It was during this period that humans first met the ancient race of dwarves and traveled to their cavernous subterranean city of Ironforge. The humans and dwarves shared many secrets of metal-smithing and engineering and discovered a common love for battle and storytelling.",

Yet even as the economy of Arathor flourished, its strongest elements began to disintegrate.",

",

Far to the north of Dalaran, the lords of Strom built a new city-state which they named Lordaeron. The entire continent would take its name from this city-state. Lordaeron became a mecca for religious travelers and all those who sought inner peace and security. ",
					"The descendents of the Arathi, left within the crumbling walls of ancient Strom, decided to travel south past the rocky mountains of Khaz Modan. Their journey finally ended after many long seasons, and they settled in the northern region of the continent they would name Azeroth. In a fertile valley they founded the kingdom of Stormwind, which quickly became a self-sufficient power in its own right. ",
					"The few warriors still left in Strom decided to remain and guard the ancient walls of their city. Strom was no longer the center of the empire, but it developed into a new nation known as Stromgarde. Though each of the city-states became prosperous in its own right, the empire of Arathor had effectively disintegrated. As each nation developed its own customs and beliefs, they became increasingly segregated from one another. King Thoradin's vision of a unified humanity had faded at last.",

Though Queen Azshara was loved equally by all of her people, the high-borne were secretly hated by the jealous masses.\r\n\r\nSharing the priests' curiosity towards the Well of Eternity, Azshara ordered the educated high-borne to plumb its secrets and reveal its true purpose in the world. ",
					"The high-borne buried themselves in their work and studied the Well ceaselessly. In time they developed the ability to manipulate and control the Well's cosmic energies. As their reckless experiments progressed, the high-borne found that they could use their newfound powers to either create or destroy at their leisure. The hapless high-borne had stumbled upon primitive magic and were now resolved to devote themselves to its mastery.",
					"Although they agreed that magic was inherently dangerous if handled irresponsibly, Azshara and her highborne began to practice their spellcraft with reckless abandon. Cenarius and many of the wizened night elf scholars warned that only calamity would result from toying with the clearly volatile arts of magic. But, Azshara and her followers stubbornly continued to expand their burgeoning powers.",
					"As their powers grew, a distinct change came over Azshara and the high-borne. The haughty, aloof upper class became increasingly callous and cruel towards their fellow night elves. A dark, brooding pall veiled Azshara's once entrancing beauty. She began to withdraw from her loving subjects and refused to interact with any but her trusted high-borne priests.",
					"A young, brazen scholar named Furion Stormrage, who had spent much of his time studying the Well's effects, began to suspect that a terrible power was corrupting the high-borne and his beloved Queen. Though he could not conceive the evil that was to come, he knew that the night elves' lives would soon be changed forever....",

As part of its northern campaign, the Horde succeeded in burning down the borderlands of Quel'Thalas, thereby ensuring the elves' final commitment to the Alliance's cause.

For his recklessness, Gul'dan was torn apart by the maddened demons he had set loose. With their leader dead, the renegade clans quickly fell before Doomhammer's enraged legions.",

After many peaceful years of growth and commerce, mighty Thoradin departed on one final quest, never to return, leaving Arathor's younger generation free to expand the empire beyond the lands of Strom.",

These magi, initially chosen for their strong wills and noble spirits, had always practiced their magic with care and responsibility; however, they passed their secrets and powers onto a newer generation that had no concept of the rigors of war or the necessity for self-restraint. ",
					"These younger magicians began to practice magic for personal gain rather than out of any responsibility towards their fellows. ",

Wielding their mystical powers, the magicians protected their brethren from the wild creatures of the land and made it possible for new city-states to be constructed in the wilderness. Yet, as their powers grew, the magicians became ever more conceited and isolated from the rest of society.",
					"The second Arathorian city-state of Dalaran was founded in the lands north of Strom. Many fledgling wizards left the restraining confines of Strom behind and traveled to Dalaran, where they hoped to use their new powers with greater freedom. These magicians used their skills to build up the enchanted spires of Dalaran and reveled in the pursuit of their studies. ",
					"The citizens of Dalaran tolerated the magicians' endeavors and built up a bustling economy under the protection of their magic-using defenders. Yet, as more and more magicians practiced their arts, the fabric of reality around Dalaran began to weaken and tear.",
					"The sinister agents of the Burning Legion, who had been banished when the Well of Eternity collapsed, were lured back into the world by the heedless spellcasting of the magicians of Dalaran. Though these relatively weak demons did not appear in force, they did sew considerable confusion and chaos within the streets of Dalaran. ",
					"Most of these demonic encounters were isolated events, and the ruling Magocrats did what they could to keep such events hidden from the public. The most powerful magicians were sent to capture the elusive demons, but they often found themselves hopelessly outmatched by the lone agents of the mighty Legion.",
					"After a few months the superstitious peasantry began to suspect that their sorcerous rulers were hiding something terrible from them. Rumors of revolution began to sweep through the streets of Dalaran as the paranoid citizenry questioned the motives and practices of the magicians they had once admired. The Magocrats, fearing that the peasants would revolt and that Strom would take action against them, turned to the only group they felt would understand their particular problem: the elves.",
					"Upon hearing the Magocrats' news of demonic activity in Dalaran, the elves quickly dispatched their mightiest wizards to the human lands. The elven wizards studied the energy currents in Dalaran and made detailed reports of all demonic activity that they beheld. They concluded that although there were only a few demons loose in the world, the Legion itself would remain a dire threat so long as humans continued to wield the forces of magic. ",
					"The Council of Silvermoon, which ruled over the elves of Quel'Thalas, entered into a secret pact with the Magocrat lords of Dalaran. The elves told the Magocrats about the history of ancient Kalimdor and of the Burning Legion, a history which still threatened the world. They informed the humans that so long as they used magic, they would need to protect their citizenry from the malicious agents of the Legion. ",
					"The Magocrats proposed the notion of empowering a single mortal champion who would utilize their powers in order to fight a never-ending secret war against the Legion. It was stressed that the majority of mankind could never know about the Guardians or the threat of the Legion for fear that they would riot in fear and paranoia. The elves agreed to the proposal and founded a secret society that would watch over the selection of the Guardian and help to stem the rise of chaos in the world.",
					"The society held its secret meetings in the shadowed Tirisfal Glades, where the high elves had first settled in Lordaeron. Thus, they named the secret sect the Guardians of Tirisfal. The mortal champions who were chosen to be Guardians were imbued with incredible powers of both elven and human magic. Though there would only ever be one Guardian at a time, they held such vast power that they could single-handedly fight back the Legion's agents wherever they were found in the world. ",
					"The Guardian power was so great that only the Council of Tirisfal was allowed to choose potential successors to the mantle of Guardianship. Whenever a Guardian grew too old, or wearied of the secret war against chaos, the Council chose a new champion, and under controlled conditions, formally channeled the Guardian power into its new agent.",
					"As the generations passed, Guardians defended the masses of humanity from the invisible threat of the Burning Legion throughout the lands of Arathor and Quel'Thalas. Arathor grew and prospered while the use of magic spread throughout the empire. Meanwhile, the Guardians kept careful watch for signs of demonic activity. ",

One of the last Guardians of the age distinguished herself as a mighty warrior against the shadow. ",

					"She believed that the ancient elves and the elderly men who presided over the council were too rigid in their thinking and not farsighted enough to put a decisive end to the conflict against chaos. Impatient with lengthy discussion and debate, she yearned to prove herself worthy to her peers and superiors, and as a result frequently chose valor over wisdom in crucial situations.",
					"As her mastery over the cosmic power of Tirisfal grew, Aegwynn became aware of a number of powerful demons that stalked the icy northern continent of Northrend. Traveling to the distant north, Aegwynn tracked the demons into the mountains. There, she found that the demons were hunting one of the last surviving dragonflights and draining the ancient creatures of their innate magic. ",
					"The mighty dragons, who had fled from the ever-advancing march of mortal societies, found themselves too evenly matched against the dark magics of the Legion. Aegwynn confronted the demons, and with help from the noble dragons, eradicated them. Yet, as the last demon was banished from the mortal world, a great storm erupted throughout the north.",

He informed the young Guardian that the time of Tirisfal was about to come to an end and that the world would soon bow before the onslaught of the Legion. ",
					"The proud Aegwynn, believing herself to be a match for the menacing god, unleashed her powers against Sargeras' avatar. With disconcerting ease, Aegwynn battered the demonlord with her powers and succeeded in killing his physical shell. Fearing that Sargeras' spirit would linger on, Aegwynn locked the ruined husk of his body within one of the ancient halls of Kalimdor that had been blasted to the bottom of the sea when the Well of Eternity collapsed. ",

She had inadvertently sealed the fate of the mortal world, for Sargeras, at the time of his corporeal death, had transferred his spirit into Aegwynn's weakened body. Unbeknownst to the young Guardian, Sargeras would remain cloaked within the darkest recesses of her soul for many long years.",

The Legion was comprised of a million screaming demons, all ripped from the far corners of the universe, and the demons hungered for conquest.

To show their allegiance to the Legion, the Highborne aided their queen in opening a vast, swirling portal within the depths of the Well of Eternity. ",

A band of burning, bloodletting killers known as the Doomguard marched across Kalimdor's fields, slaughtering everyone in their path. Packs of wild, demonic felhounds ravaged the countryside unopposed. Though the brave Kaldorei warriors rushed to defend their ancient homeland, they were forced to give ground, inch by inch, before the fury of the Legion's onslaught.",

However, with Tyrande's patient support, he was able to restrain himself and help his brother find the reclusive demigod, Cenarius. ",
					"Cenarius, who dwelt within the sacred Moonglades of the distant Mount Hyjal, agreed to help the night elves by finding the ancient dragons and enlisting their aid. The dragons, led by the great red leviathan, Alexstrasza, agreed to send their mighty flights to engage the demons and their infernal masters.",
					"Cenarius, calling on the spirits of the enchanted forests, rallied an army of ancient tree-men and led them against the Legion in a daring ground assault. As the night elves' allies converged upon Azshara's temple and the Well of Eternity, all-out warfare erupted. Despite the strength of their newfound allies, Malfurion and his colleagues realized that the Legion could not be defeated by martial strength alone. ",
					"As the titanic battle raged around Azshara's capital city, the delusional queen waited in anticipation for Sargeras' arrival. The lord of the Legion was preparing to pass through the Well of Eternity and enter the ravaged world. As his impossibly huge shadow drew ever closer to the Well's surface, Azshara gathered the most powerful of her Highborne followers. Only by linking their magics together in one focused spell would they be able to create a gateway large enough for Sargeras to enter.",
					"As the battle raged across the burning fields of Kalimdor, a terrible turn of events unfolded. The details of the event have been lost to time, but it is known that Neltharion, the Dragon Aspect of the Earth, went mad during a critical engagement against the Burning Legion. He began to split apart as flame and rage erupted from his dark hide. Renaming himself Deathwing, the burning dragon turned on his brethren and drove the five dragonflights from the field of battle.

Malfurion and his companions, now hopelessly outnumbered, barely survived the ensuing onslaught. ",

					"The power-hungry Gul'dan, obsessed with obtaining godhood itself, set out on a desperate search for the undersea Tomb of Sargeras that he believed held the secrets of ultimate power. Having already doomed his fellow orcs to become the slaves of the Burning Legion, Gul'dan thought nothing of his supposed duty to Doomhammer.",
					"Backed by the Stormreaver and Twilight's Hammer clans, Gul'dan succeeded in raising the Tomb of Sargeras from the sea floor. However, when he opened the ancient, flooded vault, he found only crazed demons awaiting him.",
					"Seeking to punish the wayward orcs for their costly betrayal, Doomhammer sent his forces to kill Gul'dan and bring the renegades back into the fold. For his recklessness, Gul'dan was torn apart by the maddened demons he had set loose. With their leader dead, the renegade clans quickly fell before Doomhammer's enraged legions.",
					"Though the rebellion had been quelled, the Horde was unable to recoup the terrible losses it had suffered. Gul'dan's betrayal had afforded the Alliance not only hope, but also time to regroup and retaliate.",
					"Lord Lothar, seeing that the Horde was fracturing from within, gathered the last of his forces and pushed Doomhammer south, back into the shattered heartland of Stormwind. There, the Alliance forces trapped the retreating Horde within the volcanic fortress of Blackrock Spire. Though Lord Lothar fell in battle at the Spire's base, his lieutenant, Turalyon, rallied the Alliance forces at the eleventh hour and drove the Horde back into the abysmal Swamp of Sorrows. ",
					"Turalyon's forces succeeded in destroying the Dark Portal, the mystical gateway that connected the orcs to their homeworld of Draenor. Cut off from its reinforcements and fractured by infighting, the Horde finally buckled in upon itself and fell before the might of the Alliance.",
					"The scattered orc clans were quickly rounded up and placed within guarded internment camps. Though it seemed that the Horde had been defeated for good, some remained highly skeptical that peace would last. Khadgar, now an Archmage of some renown, convinced the Alliance high command to build the fortress of Nethergarde that would watch over the ruins of the Dark Portal and ensure that there would be no further invasions from Draenor.",

					"There were a handful of powerful individuals scattered throughout the world who heard the Lich King's mental summons from Northrend. Most notable of them was the archmage of Dalaran, Kel'Thuzad, who was one of senior members of the Kirin Tor, Dalaran's ruling council. He had been considered a maverick for years due to his insistence on studying the forbidden arts of necromancy. ",
					"Driven to learn all he could of the magical world and its shadowy wonders, he was frustrated by what he saw as his peers' outmoded and unimaginative precepts. Upon hearing the powerful summons from Northrend, the archmage bent all of his considerable will to communing with the mysterious voice. Convinced that the Kirin Tor was too squeamish to seize the power and knowledge inherent in the dark arts, he resigned himself to learn what he could from the immensely powerful Lich King.",
					"Leaving behind his fortune and prestigious political standing, Kel'Thuzad abandoned the ways of the Kirin Tor and left Dalaran forever. Prodded by the Lich King's persistent voice in his mind, he sold his vast holdings and stored away his fortunes. Traveling alone over many leagues of both land and sea, he finally reached the frozen shores of Northrend.",
					"Intent on reaching Icecrown and offering his services to the Lich King, the archmage passed through the ravaged, war-torn ruins of Azjol-Nerub. Kel'Thuzad saw firsthand the scope and ferocity of Ner'zhul's power. He began to realize that allying himself with the mysterious Lich King might be both wise and potentially fruitful.",
					"After long months of trekking through the harsh arctic wastelands, Kel'Thuzad finally reached the dark glacier of Icecrown. He boldly approached Ner'zhul's dark citadel and was shocked when the undead guardsmen silently let him pass as though he was expected. ",
					"Kel'Thuzad descended deep into the cold earth and found his way down to the bottom of the glacier. There, in the endless cavern of ice and shadows, he prostrated himself before the Frozen Throne and offered his soul to the dark lord of the dead.",
					"The Lich King was pleased with his latest conscript. He promised Kel'Thuzad immortality and great power in exchange for his loyalty and obedience. Eager for dark knowledge and power, Kel'Thuzad accepted his first great mission: to go into the world of men and found a new religion that would worship the Lich King as a god.",
					"To help the archmage accomplish his mission, Ner'zhul left Kel'Thuzad's humanity intact. The aged yet still charismatic wizard was charged with using his powers of illusion and persuasion to lull the downtrodden, disenfranchised masses of Lordaeron into a state of trust and belief. Then, once he had their attention, he would offer them a new vision of what society could be - and a new figurehead to call their king.",
					"Kel'Thuzad returned to Lordaeron in disguise, and over the span of three years, he used his fortune and intellect to gather a clandestine brotherhood of like-minded men and women. The brotherhood, which he called the Cult of the Damned, promised its acolytes social equality and eternal life on Azeroth in exchange for their service and obedience to Ner'zhul. ",
					"As the months passed, Kel'Thuzad found many eager volunteers for his new cult amongst the tired, overburdened laborers of Lordaeron. It was surprisingly easy for Kel'Thuzad to achieve his goal: namely, to transfer the citizens' faith in the Holy Light into belief in Ner'zhul's dark shadow. As the Cult of the Damned grew in size and influence, Kel'Thuzad made sure to hide its workings from the authorities of Lordaeron.",
					"With Kel'Thuzad's success in Lordaeron, the Lich King made the final preparations for his assault against human civilization. Placing his plague-energies into a number of portable artifacts called plague-cauldrons, Ner'zhul ordered Kel'Thuzad to transport the cauldrons to Lordaeron, where they would be hidden within various cult-controlled villages. ",
					"The cauldrons, protected by the loyal cultists, would then act as plague-generators, sending the plague seeping out across the unsuspecting farmlands and cities of northern Lordaeron.",
					"The Lich King's plan worked perfectly. Many of Lordaeron's northern villages were contaminated almost immediately. Just as in Northrend, the citizens who contracted the plague died and arose as the Lich King's willing slaves. ",
					"The cultists under Kel'Thuzad were eager to die and be raised again in their dark lord's service. They exulted in the prospect of immortality through undeath. As the plague spread, more and more feral zombies arose in the northlands. Kel'Thuzad looked upon the Lich King's growing army and named it the Scourge, for soon it would march upon the gates of Lordaeron and scour humanity from the face of the world. ",

Do not put others at risk by antagonizing these creatures or falling into their traps.",

					"As a final incentive, Sargeras promised to bestow great power upon Gul'dan if he agreed to lead the Horde to Azeroth. Through Medivh, Sargeras told the warlock that he could become a living god if he found the undersea tomb where the Guardian Aegwynn had placed Sargeras' crippled body nearly a thousand years before.",

This portal bridged the distance between Azeroth and Draenor, and it was large enough that armies might pass through it. Gul'dan dispatched orc scouts through the portal to survey the lands which they would conquer. The returning scouts assured the Shadow Council that the world of Azeroth was ripe for the taking.",

The brave warrior claimed that warlocks were destroying the purity of the orcish spirit and that this reckless invasion would be their doom. Gul'dan, unable to risk killing such a popular hero, was forced to exile Durotan and his Frostwolf Clan into the far reaches of this new world.",

These orcs quickly set up a base of operations within the Black Morass, a dark and swampy area far to the east of the kingdom of Stormwind. As the orcs began to branch out and explore the new lands, they came into immediate conflict with the human defenders of Stormwind. \r\n",

					"As the forces of Azeroth and the Horde clashed across the kingdom, internal conflicts began to take their toll on both armies. King Llane, who believed the bestial orcs to be incapable of conquering Azeroth, contemptuously held his position at his capital of Stormwind. However, Sir Lothar became convinced that the battle should be taken directly to the enemy, and he was forced to choose between his convictions and his loyalty to the king. ",
					"Choosing to follow his instincts, Lothar stormed Medivh's tower-fortress of Karazhan with the help of the wizard's young apprentice, Khadgar. Khadgar and Lothar succeeded in vanquishing the possessed Guardian, whom they confirmed to be the source of the conflict. ",

",

Instead, they returned too late and found their beloved kingdom in smoking ruins. The orcish Horde continued to ravage the countryside and claimed the surrounding lands for its own.

The Wildhammer clan, ruled by Thane Khardros Wildhammer, inhabited the foothills and crags around the base of the mountain and sought to gain more control within the city. ",
					"The third faction, the Dark Iron clan, was ruled by the sorcerer-thane Thaurissan. The Dark Irons hid within the deepest shadows under the mountain and plotted against both their Bronzebeard and the Wildhammer cousins.",
					"For a time the three factions kept a tenuous peace, but tensions erupted when High King Anvilmar passed away from old age. The three ruling clans went to war for control of Ironforge itself. The dwarf civil war raged under the earth for many years. Eventually the Bronzebeards, who had the largest standing army, banished the Dark Irons and Wildhammers from under the mountain. ",
					"Khardros and his Wildhammer warriors traveled north through the barrier gates of Dun Algaz, and they founded their own kingdom within the distant peak of Grim Batol. There, the Wildhammers thrived and rebuilt their stores of treasure. Thaurissan and his Dark Irons did not fare as well. Humiliated and enraged by their defeat, they vowed revenge against Ironforge. Leading his people far to the south, Thaurissan founded a city (which he named after himself) within the beautiful Redridge Mountains.",
					"Prosperity and the passing of years did little to ease the Dark Iron's rancor toward their cousins. Thaurissan and his sorceress wife, Modgud, launched a two-pronged assault against both Ironforge and Grim Batol. The Dark Irons were intent on claiming all of Khaz Modan for their own. ",
					"The Dark Iron armies smashed against their cousins' strongholds and very nearly took both kingdoms. However, Madoran Bronzebeard ultimately led his clan to a decisive victory over Thaurissan's sorcerous army. Thaurissan and his servants fled back to the safety of their city, unaware of the events transpiring at Grim Batol, where Modgud's army would fare no better against Khardros and his Wildhammer warriors.

Shadows moved at her command, and dark things crawled up from the depths of the earth to stalk the Wildhammers in their own halls. Eventually Modgud broke through the gates and laid siege to the fortress itself. The Wildhammers fought desperately, Khardros himself wading through the roiling masses to slay the sorceress queen. ",

					"The combined armies of Ironforge and Grim Batol then turned south, intent on destroying Thaurissan and his Dark Irons once and for all. They had not gone far when Thaurissan's fury resulted in a spell of cataclysmic proportions. Seeking to summon a supernatural minion that would ensure his victory, Thaurissan called upon the ancient powers sleeping beneath the world. To his shock, and ultimately his doom, the creature that emerged was more terrible than any nightmare he could have imagined.",
					"Ragnaros the Firelord, immortal lord of all fire elementals, had been banished by the Titans when the world was young. Now, freed by Thaurissan's call, Ragnaros erupted into being once again. Ragnaros' apocalyptic rebirth into Azeroth shattered the Redridge Mountains and created a raging volcano at the center of the devastation. ",

Though Thaurissan was killed by the forces he had unleashed, his surviving brethren were ultimately enslaved by Ragnaros and his elementals. They remain within the depths of Blackrock to this day. ",
					"Witnessing the horrific devastation and the fires spreading across the southern mountains, King Madoran and King Khardros halted their armies and hastily turned back towards their kingdoms, unwilling to face the awesome wrath of Ragnaros. ",
					"The Bronzebeards returned to Ironforge and rebuilt their glorious city. The Wildhammers also returned home to Grim Batol. However, the death of the Modgud had left an evil stain on the mountain fortress, and the Wildhammers found it uninhabitable.",
					" They were bitter in their hearts over the loss of their beloved home. King Bronzebeard offered the Wildhammers a place to live within the borders of Ironforge, but the Wildhammers steadfastly refused. Khardros took his people north towards the lands of Lordaeron. Settling within the lush forests of the Hinterlands, the Wildhammers crafted the city of Aerie Peak, where the Wildhammers grew closer to nature and even bonded with the mighty gryphons of the area.",
					"Seeking to retain relations and trade with their cousins, the dwarves of Ironforge constructed two massive arches, the Thandol Span, to bridge the gap between Khaz Modan and Lordaeron. Bolstered by mutual trade, the two kingdoms prospered. After the deaths of Madoran and Khardros, their sons jointly commissioned two great statues in honor of their fathers. ",
					"The two statues would stand guard over the pass into the southlands, which had become volcanic in the wake of Ragnaros' scorching presence. They served as both a warning to all who would attack the dwarven kingdoms, and as a reminder of what price the Dark Irons paid for their crimes. ",
					"The two kingdoms retained close ties for some years, but the Wildhammers were much changed by the horrors they witnessed at Grim Batol. They took to living above ground on the slopes of Aerie Peak, instead of carving a vast kingdom within the mountain.

One hundred men were taught the very basics of the elves' magical secrets: no more than was absolutely necessary to combat the trolls.

The dreadlords served as his personal agents throughout the universe, and they took pleasure in locating primitive races for their master to corrupt and bring into the fold. First amongst the dreadlords was Tichondrius the Darkener. Tichondrius served Kil'jaeden as the perfect soldier and agreed to bring Sargeras' burning will to all the dark corners of the universe.",

He had been considered a maverick for years due to his insistence on studying the forbidden arts of necromancy. ",

Upon hearing the powerful summons from Northrend, the archmage bent all of his considerable will to communing with the mysterious voice. Convinced that the Kirin Tor was too squeamish to seize the power and knowledge inherent in the dark arts, he resigned himself to learn what he could from the immensely powerful Lich King.",
					"Leaving behind his fortune and prestigious political standing, Kel'Thuzad abandoned the ways of the Kirin Tor and left Dalaran forever. Prodded by the Lich King's persistent voice in his mind, he sold his vast holdings and stored away his fortunes. Traveling alone over many leagues of both land and sea, he finally reached the frozen shores of Northrend.",

Then, once he had their attention, he would offer them a new vision of what society could be - and a new figurehead to call their king.",

As the Cult of the Damned grew in size and influence, Kel'Thuzad made sure to hide its workings from the authorities of Lordaeron.",

As the plague spread, more and more feral zombies arose in the northlands.

A number of large internment camps, meant to house the captive orcs, were constructed in southern Lordaeron. Guarded by both the paladins and the veteran soldiers of the Alliance, the camps proved to be a great success. ",
					"Though the captive orcs were tense and anxious to do battle once more, the various camp wardens, based at the old prison-fortress of Durnholde, kept the peace and maintained a strong semblance of order.",
					"However, on the hellish world of Draenor, a new orcish army prepared to strike at the unsuspecting Alliance. Ner'zhul, the former mentor of Gul'dan, rallied the remaining orc clans under his dark banner. Aided by the Shadowmoon clan, the old shaman planned to open a number of portals on Draenor that would lead the Horde to new, unspoiled worlds. ",
					"To power his new portals, he needed a number of enchanted artifacts from Azeroth. To procure them, Ner'zhul reopened the Dark Portal and sent his ravenous servants charging through it.",
					"The new Horde, led by veteran chieftains such as Grom Hellscream and Kilrogg Deadeye (of the Bleeding Hollow clan), surprised the Alliance defense forces and rampaged through the countryside. Under Ner'zhul's surgical command, the orcs quickly rounded up the artifacts that they needed and fled back to the safety of Draenor.",
					"King Terenas of Lordaeron, convinced that the orcs were preparing a new invasion of Azeroth, assembled his most trusted lieutenants. He ordered General Turalyon and the archmage, Khadgar, to lead an expedition through the Dark Portal to put an end to the orcish threat once and for all. Turalyon and Khadgar's forces marched into Draenor and repeatedly clashed with Ner'zhul's clans upon the ravaged Hellfire Peninsula. ",
					"Even with the aid of the high elf Alleria Windrunner, the dwarf Kurdran Wildhammer, and the veteran soldier Danath Trollbane, Khadgar was unable to prevent Ner'zhul from opening his portals to other worlds.",
					"Ner'zhul finally opened his portals to other worlds, but he did not foresee the terrible price he would pay. The portals' tremendous energies began to tear the very fabric of Draenor apart. As Turalyon's forces fought desperately to return home to Azeroth, the world of Draenor began to buckle in upon itself. Grom Hellscream and Kilrogg Deadeye, realizing that Ner'zhul's mad plans would doom their entire race, rallied the remaining orcs and escaped back to the relative safety of Azeroth.",

For them, and the remaining orcs on Azeroth, there would be no going back.",

					"Ten thousand years before the orcs and humans clashed in their First War, the world of Azeroth cradled only one massive continent surrounded by the infinite, raging seas. That land mass, known as Kalimdor, was home to a number of disparate races and creatures, all vying for survival amongst the savage elements of the waking world. At the dark continent's center was a mysterious lake of incandescent energies.",
					"The lake, which would later be called the Well of Eternity, was the true heart of the world's magic and natural power. Drawing its energies from the infinite Great Dark beyond the world, the Well acted as a mystical fount, sending its potent energies out across the world to nourish life in all its wondrous forms.\r\n\r\nIn time, a primitive tribe of nocturnal humanoids cautiously made their way to the edges of the mesmerizing, enchanted lake.",
					"The feral, nomadic humanoids, drawn by the Well's strange energies, built crude homes upon its tranquil shores. Over time, the Well's cosmic power affected the strange tribe, making them strong, wise and virtually immortal. The tribe adopted the name Kaldorei, which meant -children of the stars- in their native tongue. To celebrate their budding society, they constructed great structures and temples around the lake's periphery.",
					"The Kaldorei, or night elves as they would later be known, worshipped the moon goddess, Elune, and believed that she slept within the Well's shimmering depths during the daylight hours. The early night elf priests and seers studied the Well with an insatiable curiosity, driven to plumb its untold secrets and power. As their society grew, the night elves explored the\r\nbreadth of Kalimdor and encountered its myriad denizens.",
					"The only creatures that gave them pause were the ancient and powerful dragons. Though\r\nthe great serpentine beasts were often reclusive, they did much to safeguard the known lands from potential threats. The night elves believed that the dragons held themselves to be the protectors of the world, and that they and their secrets were best left alone.",
					"In time, the night elves' curiosity led them to meet and befriend a number of powerful entities, not the least of which was Cenarius, a mighty demi-god of the primordial forestlands. The great-hearted Cenarius grew fond of the inquisitive night elves and spent a great deal of time teaching them about the natural world. The tranquil Kaldorei developed a strong empathy for the living forests of Kalimdor and reveled in the harmonious balance of nature.",
					"Yet, as the seemingly endless ages passed, the night elves' civilization expanded both territorially and culturally. Their temples, roads, and dwelling places stretched across the breadth of the dark continent. Azshara, the night elves' beautiful and gifted Queen, built an immense, wondrous palace on the Well's shore that housed her favored servitors within its bejeweled halls. ",
					"Her servitors, whom she called the Quel'dorei or -high-borne,- doted on her every command and believed themselves to be greater than the rest of their lower-caste brethren. Though Queen Azshara was loved equally by all of her people, the high-borne were secretly hated by the jealous masses.\r\n\r\nSharing the priests' curiosity towards the Well of Eternity, Azshara ordered the educated high-borne to plumb its secrets and reveal its true purpose in the world. ",
					"The high-borne buried themselves in their work and studied the Well ceaselessly. In time they developed the ability to manipulate and control the Well's cosmic energies. As their reckless experiments progressed, the high-borne found that they could use their newfound powers to either create or destroy at their leisure. The hapless high-borne had stumbled upon primitive magic and were now resolved to devote themselves to its mastery.",
					"Although they agreed that magic was inherently dangerous if handled irresponsibly, Azshara and her highborne began to practice their spellcraft with reckless abandon. Cenarius and many of the wizened night elf scholars warned that only calamity would result from toying with the clearly volatile arts of magic. But, Azshara and her followers stubbornly continued to expand their burgeoning powers.",
					"As their powers grew, a distinct change came over Azshara and the high-borne. The haughty, aloof upper class became increasingly callous and cruel towards their fellow night elves. A dark, brooding pall veiled Azshara's once entrancing beauty. She began to withdraw from her loving subjects and refused to interact with any but her trusted high-borne priests.",
					"A young, brazen scholar named Furion Stormrage, who had spent much of his time studying the Well's effects, began to suspect that a terrible power was corrupting the high-borne and his beloved Queen. Though he could not conceive the evil that was to come, he knew that the night elves' lives would soon be changed forever....",

The Magocrats who ruled Dalaran founded the Kirin Tor, a specialized sect that was charged with cataloguing and researching every spell, artifact, and magic item known to mankind at the time. ",

It was during this period that humans first met the ancient race of dwarves and traveled to their cavernous subterranean city of Ironforge. The humans and dwarves shared many secrets of metal-smithing and engineering and discovered a common love for battle and storytelling.",

Over time, Kul Tiras built up a mighty fleet of merchant vessels that sailed throughout the known lands in search of exotic goods to trade and sell. Yet even as the economy of Arathor flourished, its strongest elements began to disintegrate.",
					"In time, the lords of Strom sought to move their estates to the lush northlands of Lordaeron and leave the arid lands of the south. The heirs of King Thoradin, the last descendants of the Arathi bloodline, argued that Strom should not be abandoned and thus incurred the displeasure of the greater citizenry, who were likewise eager to leave. ",

Far to the north of Dalaran, the lords of Strom built a new city-state which they named Lordaeron. The entire continent would take its name from this city-state. Lordaeron became a mecca for religious travelers and all those who sought inner peace and security. ",
					"The descendents of the Arathi, left within the crumbling walls of ancient Strom, decided to travel south past the rocky mountains of Khaz Modan. Their journey finally ended after many long seasons, and they settled in the northern region of the continent they would name Azeroth. In a fertile valley they founded the kingdom of Stormwind, which quickly became a self-sufficient power in its own right. ",
					"The few warriors still left in Strom decided to remain and guard the ancient walls of their city. Strom was no longer the center of the empire, but it developed into a new nation known as Stromgarde. Though each of the city-states became prosperous in its own right, the empire of Arathor had effectively disintegrated. As each nation developed its own customs and beliefs, they became increasingly segregated from one another. King Thoradin's vision of a unified humanity had faded at last.",

After a few years, many of them began to go mad. It was theorized that something evil slept beneath that particular part of the world, but the rumors were never proven to be true. The high elves packed up their encampment and moved northward towards another land rich with ley energies.",

Since they were effectively cut off from the life-giving energies of the Well of Eternity, many of them fell ill from the frigid climate or died from starvation. The most disconcerting change, however, was the fact that they were no longer immortal or immune to the elements. ",

They also found tribes of primitive humans who hunted throughout the ancient forestlands. However, the direst threat they encountered were the voracious and cunning forest trolls of Zul'Aman.",

The Amani empire stretched across most of northern Lordaeron, and the trolls fought hard to keep unwanted strangers from their borders. The elves developed a deep loathing for the vicious trolls and killed them on sight whenever they were encountered.",
					"After many long years, the high elves finally found a land which was reminiscent of Kalimdor. Deep within the northern forests of the continent, they founded the kingdom of Quel'Thalas and vowed to create a mighty empire which would dwarf that of their Kaldorei cousins. Unfortunately they soon learned that Quel'Thalas was founded upon an ancient troll city that the trolls still held to be sacred. Almost immediately, the trolls began to attack the elven settlements en masse. ",
					"The stubborn elves, unwilling to give up their new land, utilized the magics which they had gleaned from the Well of Eternity and kept the savage trolls at bay. Under Dath'Remar's leadership, they were able to defeat the Amani warbands that outnumbered them ten to one. Some elves, wary of the Kaldorei's ancient warnings, felt that their use of magic might possibly draw the attention of the banished Burning Legion. ",
					"Therefore, they decided to mask their lands within a protective barrier which would still allow them to work their enchantments. They constructed a series of monolithic Runestones at various points around Quel'Thalas which marked the boundaries of the magic barrier. The Runestones not only masked the elves' magic from extra-dimensional threats, but helped to frighten away the superstitious troll warbands as well.",
					"As time wore on, Quel'Thalas became a shining monument to the high elves' efforts and magical prowess. Its beauteous palaces were crafted in the same architectural style as the ancient halls of Kalimdor, yet they were interwoven with the natural topography of the land. Quel'Thalas had become the shining jewel that the elves had longed to create. ",
					"The Convocation of Silvermoon was founded as the ruling power over Quel'Thalas, though the Sunstrider Dynasty maintained a modicum of political power. Comprised of seven of the greatest high elf lords, the Convocation worked to secure the safety of the elven lands and people. Surrounded by their protective barrier, the high elves remained unmoved by the old warnings of the Kaldorei and continued to use magic flagrantly in almost all aspects of their lives. ",

They plotted and schemed in the depths of the forests and waited for the numbers of their warbands to grow.

Her voice seductively brushed his pointy ears with the rough texture of someone who inhaled too much motorcycle exhaust.  \r\n\r\nThe goblin called Jack looked up and grinned.  "Revi!

"Is that... is it... real?"  \r\n\r\nFeeling the advantage, Jack allowed himself to relax a bit.  Putting his hands behind his head and leaning back in his chair, he replied with lazily narrowed eyes, "It\'s 100% goblin parts, baby.  Natural resources."  \r\n\r\nAfter a moment of hesitation, Revi reached out and gingerly stroked the smooth yellow surface.  "I\'ll take two!"\r\n \r\n"Excellent!

					'Marcus galloped on his warhorse towards the remote building, bringing an almost imperceptible flush to one of the curvier guards as he passed.  He dismounted and handed his reins to the ever-present stablemaster, placing one hand on her shoulder before speaking.  "Kama, have you considered our last conversation?" Marcus asked, furrowing his eyebrows in mock seriousness.  \r\n\r\nKama rolled her eyes, her Pandaren markings exaggerating the movement.

"Madam Goya, the pleasure is all mine."  \r\n\r\nShe dipped in a polite bow; Marcus felt a sudden warmth as he was reminded why the term bouncy was often used to describe the Pandaren.  He bowed in kind, catching Madam Goya\'s hand and kissing it gently, never shifting his gaze from the hulking bodyguard standing behind her, a single scar between his watchful eyes.',
					'"So, Marcus, can I interest you in something... special?  I\'m afraid the usual cannot be offered today."  Marcus did not miss her emphasis on \'the usual\', nor the deep regret that laced her words.  Their eyes met once again and she squeezed his hand before letting go.\r\n \r\n"If that is your will, may I see what you have to offer?" Marcus asked.  \r\n\r\n"There are several magnificent pieces of armor, a tiny companion, and even an exotic mount," Madam Goya answered, her typical playfulness quickly returning.  She paused and held a hand to her chin, feigning thoughtfulness.  "But my most valuable treasures are located upstairs."  \r\n\r\nMarcus\'s eyebrows lifted comically and his eyes widened before his expression settled into gleeful acceptance.  "Until we meet again, then."  Her eyes fluttered and Marcus found himself walking up the stairs of the strange tavern.',

One had long flowing hair the color of the Sunwell itself, and the other kept her ebon hair cropped short.  After several long moments of wordless, lust-filled glances, a realization struck him: he was looking into the face of the enemy!  He unsheathed his mighty sword, bathing the blood elves in its pulsating glow.\r\n \r\nThe elf with radiant hair spoke first, "Goodness, it looks like someone is ready for battle."  She placed her hand on the tip of his sword, lowering it with gentle pressure as she crossed in front of him, always keeping her head cocked in his direction.  "Do you believe in love at first sight?  Or should I walk by again...?"  \r\n\r\nMarcus leaned in close, carelessly pressing the hardened steel against her.  He whispered something quietly in her ear and pulled away, eagerly searching her face for a reaction.',
					'"No.  No.  I won\'t do that... but my sister will!" the blonde giggled.  The dark-haired one silently raised a single eyebrow, nodding and shrugging her delicate shoulders at the same time.  With a subtle gesture, her body glowed with an intense inner fire, burning away what little clothing she wore.  As Marcus\'s muscular arms wrapped around her, she whispered something to him.  A symbol, unseen by Marcus, momentarily appeared above his head and surrounded him in a white glow.  \r\n"That... that feels amazing.  What did you do?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Fortitude, my lord.

					'A trail of dust followed the once-white stallion as he galloped through the garrison gates, stopping abruptly at the stables.  Raven, the stable master, rushed to the weary mount and rider.\r\n\r\n"Lord Marcus, let me help."  Raven\'s strong, tanned arm took the rider\'s hand in his own, pulling him off in a quick, smooth motion.  He did not immediately let go, staring in disbelief at the paladin\'s heavily stained armor.\r\n\r\nSeeing concern on the man\'s face, Marcus clasped his shoulder and smiled warmly. "Fear not old friend, only a little of it is my own."\r\n\r\nRaven hugged him fiercely.  "That is good to hear!"',

					'"So there I was, surrounded by at least a hundred murlocs!" the heavily-mustached man proclaimed, gesturing in a wide arc.\r\n\r\nThe tawny tauren gasped in amazement.  "What ever did you do?"  Her voice had a brawny, muscular tone to it.\r\n\r\n"The only thing I could do, my lovely."  Marcus patted the sword resting on his thigh.  "I brought them to justice!"\r\n\r\n"Oh!  With just a dagger?  You are so brave!"  Tanda cautiously reached for the blade, but pulled her hand away at the last second.\r\n\r\nMarcus bristled.  "What?  This is a two-handed sword, enchanted to the hilt.  Perhaps not as big as you\'ve seen, but I know a few tricks to really make it sing."\r\n\r\nTanda smiled demurely, fluttering her enormous eyelashes.  She picked up a piece of cheese and held it close to Marcus\'s lips.  "Try this, it\'s homemade."\r\n\r\nThe handsome paladin stammered, "N-no.  I\'m, um, lactose intolerant."',
					'Tanda placed the cheese back in the bowl.  "Oh, are you sure?  Does that mean you can\'t tolerate me?"  The buxxom tauren stepped forward, pressing herself against Marcus.  The substantial height difference placed his face squarely in her chest.  Unable to see, he flailed in protest, finally finding purchase on her firm backside -- his muffled apologetic sounds only made her giggle and squeeze him more tightly.\r\n\r\nJust as his other hand found her tail, the light dimmed as an imposing figure moved into the doorway.  "What the..."\r\n\r\nTanda exclaimed, "Bax, no!"\r\n\r\nMarcus pulled his head away and gasped for air, looking at the angry tauren with wide eyes.  "It\'s not what it looks like!"\r\n\r\nBax charged, ramming into Marcus while uttering his challenge, "You mess with the bull, you get the horns!"',
					'Marcus reeled and caught himself, digging his heel into the dirt.  Seizing a horn in each hand, he held the tauren\'s head down, fighting against his tremendous strength.  Bax forced his head up, grunting and spitting in anger, only to have it repeatedly pushed down.  They locked eyes for a moment, and with a final heave of explosive force, Bax wrenched himself free.\r\n\r\nThe powerful tauren swung his arms out wide, as if to crush Marcus in a mighty hug.  "Blades of Light!" proclaimed the paladin. A huge, pulsing sword thrust up from the ground between the two combatants, tearing through armor and clothing, searing the thick chest hair of Marcus and cutting a fine line into the tauren\'s muscular chest.\r\n\r\nBefore they could move again, Tanda raised her hooved leg into the air and brought it down with warlike force.  The man and bull wobbled, clearly stunned.  "Stop it, both of you!"',
					'Marcus regained his composure and looked at Tanda, and then to Bax. Fur was ruffled and the bare parts of their leathery skin glistened with sweat.

					'Marcus awoke with a grunt, squinting to make out the dark shadows around him. He was sitting on a cold wooden floor, and the air was ripe with the scent of a long night. The room rocked back and forth. Or was that just the hangover? "Where am I?" he mumbled to himself.\r\n\r\nA sultry laugh echoed as a strong, shapely figure moved towards him. Marcus rubbed his eyes and focused his senses. She smelled of leather, salt, and exotic spices. As he looked into the woman\'s steel-grey eyes, he became aware of the bars between them. \'Am I in a cell?\' he thought to himself. \'Is this one of Madam Goya\'s rooms?\' he mused further.',
					'"You\'re in the brig, in case you haven\'t figured it out," the voluptuous pirate stated with more than a hint of amusement.\r\n\r\nMarcus stood shakily, composing himself with a roguish smirk before speaking, "I knew that. It\'s the brig... on a ship. I\'m on a ship, of course." \r\n\r\nThe woman leaned in closer, gripping the bars with surprising intensity. "Yes. On a ship. At full-mast, apparently," she added, with a flirtatious glance down and then back up to his face.',
					'Marcus grinned in response, bowing close enough to whisper through the bars, "Half-mast, although the winds seem to be strengthening." He blew gently, catching her thick black hair in the seductive currents of his breath.\r\n\r\nShe pulled away with a fleeting glance of reluctance, "I\'m just here to see if you wanted dinner." She forced a stale piece of bread through the bars.',
					'Marcus plucked the morsel from her hand. "I don\'t want anything dry right now." He dropped the rigid roll and took her hand, tracing a line from her calloused fingers to the anchor tattooed on her forearm. "Do you have any Kul Tiran fare? I\'ve heard it\'s famous for its... succulence. A rare pleasure to the tongue."\r\n\r\nA silence followed his words, interrupted by the sound of the cell door creaking open and a cutlass clattering to the floor. Marcus silently pointed to a belaying pin on the far wall and raised an eyebrow. The broad-shouldered woman purred, "Oh? I\'d have never pegged you for that."',

He watched as her fingers deftly slid along the shaft of what was unmistakably a mage\'s staff.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, my lady," Marcus said as he bowed, his eyes trailing along her shapely form as he slowly straightened and his gazed reached a face that was as lovely as it was unconcerned by the destruction she had just unleashed. \r\n\r\nA pair of sweeping horns topped sprouted from her head, which only added to the heady mix of grandeur and danger.',
					'"It seemed a waste to lose such a fine, heroic, specimen such as yourself to this rabble," she responded, her gaze wandering unabashedly.

Her skin flushed an even richer shade of red as her inspection continued.\r\n\r\n"If there is anything I or Drakepiercer, here can do for you, we are in your debt." he stated, subtly flexing muscles toned from years of adventuring as he sheathed his long blade home with a single thrust.\r\n\r\n"Anything?" she replied huskily, as her yellow eyes twinkled mischievously at the naming of his sword.\r\n\r\n"Anything," he confirmed.

It  heated his road-stained leathers and caressed the tanned flesh beneath.\r\n\r\n"Much better," she purred, slowly eyeing him from top to bottom. "The breath of a red dragoness can bring life as easily as take it. I trust my flame has not harmed you?"\r\n\r\n"On the contrary," Marcus replied as her hot breath played teasingly across his skin, "I feel positively filled with life".\r\n\r\nStepping forward, she pressed herself against the knight and grabbed the hilt of his sword appreciatively.

Bored of the one-sided conversation, the monk soon proposed a challenge of wits.\n\nThe farmhand was uninterested in testing his wits against the monk, no matter how much his roommate raised the stakes. Finally the monk offered the farmhand substantial odds: "I will give you 50 gold coins for every question of yours I cannot answer, if you will give me 5 gold coins for every question YOU cannot answer."',
					'At this, the farmhand agreed.\n\n"Very well!" exclaimed the monk. He eagerly tried to think of a question sufficient to challenge the farmhand, but simple enough to keep the game interesting. "How would one measure the volume of an irregularly shaped object?" he asked, his eyes gleaming.\n\nWithout even bothering to think about it, the farmhand handed the monk 5 gold coins.\n\nThe monk was disappointed, but prepared himself for the farmhand\'s challenge.',

For six hours he was mercifully silent as he pondered the farmhand\'s conundrum. Soon, he grew irritable. Eventually his face sunk with fury and disdain. "Alas, alas! I give up!" he cried, waving his arms. Reluctantly he withdrew a sack of coins and counted out fifty precious gold pieces for the farmhand. The tiller happily accepted his winnings.',

Portals, when used properly, are just as safe and certainly faster. HOWEVER, in practice portals have a history of being a burden on any society in which it is offered to the general public. Of all the major spells developed and maintained by the Kirin Tor (including polymorph), portal technology is the closest to becoming banished from anything but emergency usage.",
					"Why all the trouble? First, Ley Lines don't grow on trees. Massive traffic through a Line from all over Azeroth wears down the infrastructure and must be periodically replaced. We charge the mage for every portal via reagent taxes, and encourage mages to pass off these charges to those using the portal. But these taxes don't even begin to cover the time cost of replacing a Line, only the materials. \r\n",
					'Remember that a portal most used is a portal most efficient: More persons using a single portal causes no further stress to the Ley Lines, and is encouraged. A "Portalpooling" program is in the works that will give tax breaks to mages who create portals for no less than (5) persons. Read your latest issue of "Kirin Tor Monthly" to see the progress of the Portalpooling program. \r\n',
					"Second, while a properly used portal is just as safe as your average zeppelin trip (maybe more so considering the engineering practices of goblins), an improperly used portal can potentially yield dire results. Here is a list of immutable regulations for appropriate portal usage:\r\n",
					"Rule #1: Do not create a portal to anywhere but the designated Kirin Tor portal drop-off zones. The most dangerous aspect of the portal spell is its vast potential. We realize it's easy for a mage to create a door to anywhere, so our only way to combat such potentially deadly acts is to make it punishable by death. \r\nSpecial Issue License D-6 permits open portal usage, but is rarely issued. Speak with your local Portal Trainer about qualifying for this license. \r\n",
					"Rule #2: Create a portal in the proper place, and use it in the proper way. Do not create a portal beneath the feet of someone. Do not linger halfway in and out of a portal. The portal is not a garbage disposal. The portal is not a shield. Do not use a portal like an umbrella, or any kind of shelter from the elements. \r\n",
					'Do not back out of a portal after partially entering it. Do not try and "grab" the edges of the portal, either from the inside or the outside. A portal does not create "handlebars" to assist usage, and disruption of its boundaries is dangerous. \r\n',
					"Rule #3: Never force or trick anyone to go through a portal. Not only is this is a great way to lose repeat customers, it's also incredibly dangerous (See Rule #2). \r\n",
					'Rule #4: Do not have someone who is polymorphed enter a portal. This has yet to not cause an explosion. This is also covered in "Polymorphic Rules & Regulations."\r\n',
					'Rule #5: Do not remove the liquid filter from a portal spell. Portals innately prevent large amounts of flowing water through them so that they can be cast underwater. To allow for water elementals to use a portal, this filter can be omitted when casting. Do not omit this when underwater! We feel obligated to mention Moderately Severe Claims Disaster Case 34-zz: "The Great Lakeshire Drought & The Great Ironforge Flood of 24 A.D."\r\n',
					"Rule #6: Standard Portal dimensions are 3 yards, 1 foot, 3 and 3/4 inches tall, 2 yards, 8 feet, 9 and 15/16 inches wide. Double-wide portal creation requires Special Issue License G-16, and is commonly issued to mages with a clean portal record of 8 years or more.

With that, she and her young son Liao Stormstout climbed aboard the turtle, among the first brewmasters to do so.\n\nThe Wandering Isle has not returned to Pandaria in many generations.

					"Our first day went as well as one can expect first days to go.  Most of our time was preoccupied with making the necessary arrangements to establish a base camp.  I located an ideal setting by a freshwater river inlet.  Judging by the old, abandoned docks nearby, this site was inhabited sometime ago.  As for the original inhabitants, only time can tell that tale.",
					"For this expedition I have assembled Ajeck Rouack and Sir S. J Erlgadin, along with my trusted servant, Barnil Stonepot.  I fought alongside Ajeck's father's side in many battles in defense of the Alliance.  Seeing her grown is quite special.  Her father schooled her well in the ways of weaponry.  Her skills with a bow make me wonder if there is elven blood running through those veins.",
					"Sir S. J. Erlgadin comes from human aristocracy.  His father, Count Erlgadin, was renowned for his generosity.  It was the Count who lobbied for improved working conditions for the Stonemasons' Guild during the restoration of Stormwind after the Second Great War.",
					"In the years that followed, after Stormwind betrayed the Stonemasons' Guild, Sir Erlgadin grew bitter about the role of the nobles within the Kingdom.  He no longer wished to uphold the position that his father's bloodline had earned for him in the House of Nobles.\r\n\r\nBut I digress.  The purpose of this story is not to act as a political treatise or a biography.  This is the account of my experiences hunting big game in the green hills of Stranglethorn....",
					"We rose with the sun.  Barnil began to prepare the morning meal. I noticed Ajeck's attention was somewhat distracted.  The day's trek would be long and our hunt would bring us close to danger.  A lack of focus could easily lead to an errant mishap.  Yet Ajeck seemed unable to divert her gaze from Barnil who stood by the edge of the river rinsing out his mess kit.",
					"Just as I was about to question Ajeck's lack of interest in the day's hunting strategy, she reached for her quiver, drew an arrow and unleashed a shot right towards poor Barnil.  But it was not Barnil that Ajeck was shooting at.  For when Barnil stepped aside, mouth agape, a large river crocilisk floated to the surface with Ajeck's arrow perfectly placed between his two large eyes.",
					"We set out toward the west, through the thick overgrowth of the tangled jungle.  Moving with slow, deliberate steps we paced through thick foliage in search of prey.  The morning passed in frustrated silence.  Nothing was stirring in the Vale, not even a breeze.  By the afternoon, the expedition had grown restless.  Barnil no longer strode with the cautious steps of a predator tracking prey.  Rather he clumsily clomped along the path often stepping noisily on dried leaves or fallen branches.",
					"During one such misstep, Erlgadin laid a heavy hand on Barnil's shoulder.  Ajeck and I gave a casual glance, assuming the man was simply giving Barnil a much-needed scolding for his carelessness.  Erlgadin, however, gestured slowly with his head toward a nearby fallen tree.  Gazing back at us were two piercing black eyes just above a mouthful of razor sharp fangs.",
					"The beast was a male Stranglethorn Tiger.  Before I could cock my rifle, Erlgadin raised his crossbow and fired upon the beast.  The bolt missed its mark and caught the beast heavily in the left flank.  The tiger made a futile attempt to flee but its wound was too grave.  The beast stumbled for a few tragic seconds until Barnil finished the kill with a thrown axe.",
					"The kill brought about a festive mood amongst the expedition.  Barnil poured mead for all to enjoy.  But our festivities were short-lived.  As we were preparing the corpse for transport back to base camp we were all caught off guard by a horrendous growl.  In all my years I have never heard anything so blood curdling.",
					"On a rocky precipice above, silhouetted by the setting sun, I could make out the largest cat of prey I have ever laid eyes upon.  I was able to loose one clumsy volley with my rifle, but the cat held his ground.  He growled once again, this time louder than the first, and vanished.\r\n\r\nWe gathered our belongings and headed solemnly back to camp.",
					"I had promised the expedition that we would spend the next day hunting panthers, as their furs are in high demand throughout Azeroth.  It only makes sense that such demand should exist with all of the able-bodied hunters, trappers and fur-traders off giving their lives so valiantly in the name of the Alliance.",
					"Ajeck and Sir Erlgadin were anxious to learn how to hunt effectively with a Dwarven Rifle.  I had the two humans leave their primitive range weapons at base camp.  Barnil and I outfitted them with some of Ironforge's finest firearms.",
					"On this day we ventured to the south, following some fresh panther tracks.  Soon we reached a ravine spanned by a tremendous rope bridge.  I could not help but to think of Brann's descriptive writings of this region when I saw the engineering marvel.  So often it was assumed that the native Trolls were a primitive and uneducated race yet as I gazed upon the master craftsmanship of the bridge I was able to recognize the skill with which the Troll builders overcame the seemingly impossible feat.",
					"Before long, Ajeck tracked the panther to the southwest.  We walked quietly, guns at the ready, in anticipation of our prey.  A snapping of twigs from a nearby copse of trees drew our attention immediately.  Something was in there.  One stern glance at Barnil was enough to convey my thoughts.  Barnil slowly lowered his rifle.  This kill was not for us; it was for our Human companions.  Countless panthers had lost their lives in front of our smoking barrels.  This kill would be for the Humans.",
					"Both Ajeck and Sir Erlgadin stood poised, guns leveled at the bristling overgrowth at the base of the swaying trees.  The midday sun beat heavily upon us.  A slow trickle of perspiration trailed down from Elrgadin's temple as he pulled the pin back.  Upon the sound of the click, the thick flora parted and a large black panther -- a beautiful specimen -- darted out onto the plain.",
					"The Humans trained their sights on the panther as it ran along the edge of the tree line.  The barrels of their guns moved in perfect parallel tandem.  Barnil gave me an urging glance but I shook my head no.  This hunt was for the Humans, not Barnil or me.  Erlgadin fired a booming shot, missing the panther altogether.  Apparently he was unprepared for the violent kickback of the rifle blast.",
					"His gun tossed back violently in his arms.  The barrel swooped sideways and came up beneath Ajeck's rifle.  Ajeck had chosen that exact moment to pull her trigger.  The rifle, the aim now knocked clumsily toward the tree line, went off with a distinct boom.  A flock of birds screamed out of the canopy, scattering in every direction.  A plume of smoke rose from the tree.  We watched in awe as a tremendous branch fell squarely on the fleeing panther, breaking its back",
					"As the weeks passed our stockpile of panther and tiger skins grew immense.  I decided it was time for the expedition to shift our focus to a new challenge: Raptors.\r\n\r\nThe Humans, while appreciative of the training Barnil and I offered, decided to refrain from hunting with firearms.  Ajeck was much more comfortable with a finely strung bow and Sir Erlgadin never left camp without his sturdy crossbow.",
					"We set out at first light, heading south past the Tkashi Ruins.  Barnil voiced concern that we might encounter members of the Bloodscalp Tribe.  I reminded Barnil that the Bloodscalps were more concerned with destroying their tribal enemy, the Skullsplitters.  Needless to say, Barnil was not comforted in the least.  I, however, had a loaded rifle, a satchel full of gunpowder and three deadly hunters with me to ease any concerns of an unfriendly ambush.",
					"I've stood before a towering Infernal on the battlefield, the army of the Burning Legion advancing from all directions.  An unruly band of Trolls seems as harmless as a jackrabbit in the hills of Dun Morogh.\r\n\r\nWe passed the Tkashi Ruins without event, much to Barnil's relief.  The party proceeded to head westward, toward the Great Sea, skirting the Ruins of Zul'Kunda just to the south.  As we ascended the high sea bluffs we spotted our first Raptor.",
					"The beast never so much as detected our presence.  In fact, the only greeting he received from the expedition was a bullet between the eyes.\r\n\r\nSir Erlgadin let out a hearty *hurrah* as Ajeck nodded toward me with keen approval.  I sifted through my pack in search of my pipe, hoping to enjoy a celebratory smoke.  Barnil began to scurry up the hillside to retrieve the Raptor's corpse.  I stared at the fallen beast with the satisfaction that accompanies every big kill.",
					"But I could not bask in the glory of the kill for long.  For when I turned my eyes toward the horizon, several silhouettes appeared cresting the hill, just above poor Barnil.\r\n\r\n*Flee, Barnil!* I shouted.  Ajeck, Sir Erlgadin and myself loosed a volley of bullets, arrows and bolts over Barnil and toward the pursuing raptors.  One of us landed a kill amidst the confusion.",
					"Our hastily aimed shots were enough to buy Barnil's escape.  Barnil clamored back down the hill and rejoined the party. We scurried off into the jungle; a pack of ferocious Lashtail Raptors stalking our every move.  \r\n\r\nThe hunters were now the hunted.",
					"I led the party toward the sea, hoping the shoreline would provide refuge from the Raptors.  In our haste we had drifted too far north, to a precariously high elevation.  The mistake was made.  The fault was mine.  We stopped just short of a sheer cliff, the Raptors just a few paces behind.",
					"I stepped slowly forward, gun raised.  I had led these brave hunters to their death.  I would die defending them.  Lashtail Raptors are particularly fierce, known for their unrelenting blood-thirst.  They far outnumbered us.  But I would be damned if I let them kill me and my comrades without shedding some of their own blood first.",
					"Ajeck and Sir Erlgadin readied their weapons, flanking me on either side, our backs to the sea.  Barnil let out a defeated sigh and drew his axe.  The Lashtails were almost upon us.  Their steady stride had slowed.  They were stalking their prey now for they knew they had us trapped.",
					"And then something miraculous happened.  From off to our side we heard the distinct and terrifying roar of the great white tiger.  Despite their numbers, the Raptors turned and scattered in all directions.  We saw but a brief white flash as the tiger darted past us and pounced on one of the Raptors.  No command needed to be given.  All four members of our party knew it was time to run.",
					"We sprinted all the way back to base camp, never slowing.  Later that night we sat quietly around the campfire, knowing our lives had been saved by a bizarre twist of fate.  Such are the risks of the big game hunter.  We toy with fate by delivering it.  Yet each of us, at some point, will face fate's razor sharp teeth.  This Dwarf is just glad that moment did not come upon the green hills of Stranglethorn.\r\n\r\n--The End--",

					"Once upon a time there lived a mage who could not cast fireball, polymorph, or frostbolt. When he conjured water, it came out as mud. His attempts at arcane intellect made the subjects stupider. Without any doubt, his tutors agreed that their pupil, Bungledorf, was the worst mage in Dalaran.",
					"Bungledorf had come to learn with great hopes. He guzzled mana potions before class, mistakenly believing they would increase his skill. But all they ever increased was the number of times he accidentally burped during important invocations, often setting classmates' robes ablaze or turning his teacher's beard into sheep's wool in the process.",
					"At his first exam, Bungledorf was asked to cast frost armor correctly. The other students shifted in their seats fearfully as he began the incantation. A blue fog encompassed the young lad and for a moment it looked as though he had succeeded. But then he began to shiver and sneeze violently, and everyone finally realized: he had given himself frostbite.",
					'One day Bungledorf was in the park, wondering whether he was cut out to be a mage. He saw some children playing nearby and remembered his dream of being a powerful spellcaster. "Yes," he thought, "I can do it; I just need to try harder!" He looked for something to practice on and noticed an unusual tree before him. Summoning his courage, Bungledorf began casting a spell on it. He shut his eyes, afraid to see the result...',
					'When he finally looked, the tree was replaced with a beautiful night elf. "It worked!" he cried, "It\'s transformed! I am a mage after all!"\r\n\r\nThe night elf was confused for a moment and then smiled at him gently. "I am a druid, young one. We take other forms by our own will."',
					"Bungledorf blushed and stepped away, only to trip over his robes and fall headfirst into the lawn. A chorus of giggles greeted him as he adjusted his long pointed cap and shuffled off toward the dormitory, his head hanging low.",
					"The night elf lingered, pondering the boy. When she turned to leave, she caught her foot in something, and nearly lost her balance. Surprised at the unfamiliar obstacle, she looked down to see a glistening crop of mageroyal, its petals slowly unfurling into full bloom, where moments ago there had been nothing. She wondered at this, and then, realizing, turned back in the direction Bungledorf had been walking, but the young mage was already gone.",

					"Our first day went as well as one can expect first days to go.  Most of our time was preoccupied with making the necessary arrangements to establish a base camp.  I located an ideal setting by a freshwater river inlet.  Judging by the old, abandoned docks nearby, this site was inhabited sometime ago.  As for the original inhabitants, only time can tell that tale.",
					"For this expedition I have assembled Ajeck Rouack and Sir S. J Erlgadin, along with my trusted servant, Barnil Stonepot.  I fought alongside Ajeck's father's side in many battles in defense of the Alliance.  Seeing her grown is quite special.  Her father schooled her well in the ways of weaponry.  Her skills with a bow make me wonder if there is elven blood running through those veins.",
					"Sir S. J. Erlgadin comes from human aristocracy.  His father, Count Erlgadin, was renowned for his generosity.  It was the Count who lobbied for improved working conditions for the Stonemasons' Guild during the restoration of Stormwind after the Second Great War.",
					"In the years that followed, after Stormwind betrayed the Stonemasons' Guild, Sir Erlgadin grew bitter about the role of the nobles within the Kingdom.  He no longer wished to uphold the position that his father's bloodline had earned for him in the House of Nobles.\r\n\r\nBut I digress.  The purpose of this story is not to act as a political treatise or a biography.  This is the account of my experiences hunting big game in the green hills of Stranglethorn....",
					"We rose with the sun.  Barnil began to prepare the morning meal. I noticed Ajeck's attention was somewhat distracted.  The day's trek would be long and our hunt would bring us close to danger.  A lack of focus could easily lead to an errant mishap.  Yet Ajeck seemed unable to divert her gaze from Barnil who stood by the edge of the river rinsing out his mess kit.",
					"Just as I was about to question Ajeck's lack of interest in the day's hunting strategy, she reached for her quiver, drew an arrow and unleashed a shot right towards poor Barnil.  But it was not Barnil that Ajeck was shooting at.  For when Barnil stepped aside, mouth agape, a large river crocilisk floated to the surface with Ajeck's arrow perfectly placed between his two large eyes.",
					"We set out toward the west, through the thick overgrowth of the tangled jungle.  Moving with slow, deliberate steps we paced through thick foliage in search of prey.  The morning passed in frustrated silence.  Nothing was stirring in the Vale, not even a breeze.  By the afternoon, the expedition had grown restless.  Barnil no longer strode with the cautious steps of a predator tracking prey.  Rather he clumsily clomped along the path often stepping noisily on dried leaves or fallen branches.",
					"During one such misstep, Erlgadin laid a heavy hand on Barnil's shoulder.  Ajeck and I gave a casual glance, assuming the man was simply giving Barnil a much-needed scolding for his carelessness.  Erlgadin, however, gestured slowly with his head toward a nearby fallen tree.  Gazing back at us were two piercing black eyes just above a mouthful of razor sharp fangs.",
					"The beast was a male Stranglethorn Tiger.  Before I could cock my rifle, Erlgadin raised his crossbow and fired upon the beast.  The bolt missed its mark and caught the beast heavily in the left flank.  The tiger made a futile attempt to flee but its wound was too grave.  The beast stumbled for a few tragic seconds until Barnil finished the kill with a thrown axe.",
					"The kill brought about a festive mood amongst the expedition.  Barnil poured mead for all to enjoy.  But our festivities were short-lived.  As we were preparing the corpse for transport back to base camp we were all caught off guard by a horrendous growl.  In all my years I have never heard anything so blood curdling.",
					"On a rocky precipice above, silhouetted by the setting sun, I could make out the largest cat of prey I have ever laid eyes upon.  I was able to loose one clumsy volley with my rifle, but the cat held his ground.  He growled once again, this time louder than the first, and vanished.\r\n\r\nWe gathered our belongings and headed solemnly back to camp.",
					"I had promised the expedition that we would spend the next day hunting panthers, as their furs are in high demand throughout Azeroth.  It only makes sense that such demand should exist with all of the able-bodied hunters, trappers and fur-traders off giving their lives so valiantly in the name of the Alliance.",
					"Ajeck and Sir Erlgadin were anxious to learn how to hunt effectively with a Dwarven Rifle.  I had the two humans leave their primitive range weapons at base camp.  Barnil and I outfitted them with some of Ironforge's finest firearms.",
					"On this day we ventured to the south, following some fresh panther tracks.  Soon we reached a ravine spanned by a tremendous rope bridge.  I could not help but to think of Brann's descriptive writings of this region when I saw the engineering marvel.  So often it was assumed that the native Trolls were a primitive and uneducated race yet as I gazed upon the master craftsmanship of the bridge I was able to recognize the skill with which the Troll builders overcame the seemingly impossible feat.",
					"Before long, Ajeck tracked the panther to the southwest.  We walked quietly, guns at the ready, in anticipation of our prey.  A snapping of twigs from a nearby copse of trees drew our attention immediately.  Something was in there.  One stern glance at Barnil was enough to convey my thoughts.  Barnil slowly lowered his rifle.  This kill was not for us; it was for our Human companions.  Countless panthers had lost their lives in front of our smoking barrels.  This kill would be for the Humans.",
					"Both Ajeck and Sir Erlgadin stood poised, guns leveled at the bristling overgrowth at the base of the swaying trees.  The midday sun beat heavily upon us.  A slow trickle of perspiration trailed down from Elrgadin's temple as he pulled the pin back.  Upon the sound of the click, the thick flora parted and a large black panther -- a beautiful specimen -- darted out onto the plain.",
					"The Humans trained their sights on the panther as it ran along the edge of the tree line.  The barrels of their guns moved in perfect parallel tandem.  Barnil gave me an urging glance but I shook my head no.  This hunt was for the Humans, not Barnil or me.  Erlgadin fired a booming shot, missing the panther altogether.  Apparently he was unprepared for the violent kickback of the rifle blast.",
					"His gun tossed back violently in his arms.  The barrel swooped sideways and came up beneath Ajeck's rifle.  Ajeck had chosen that exact moment to pull her trigger.  The rifle, the aim now knocked clumsily toward the tree line, went off with a distinct boom.  A flock of birds screamed out of the canopy, scattering in every direction.  A plume of smoke rose from the tree.  We watched in awe as a tremendous branch fell squarely on the fleeing panther, breaking its back",
					"As the weeks passed our stockpile of panther and tiger skins grew immense.  I decided it was time for the expedition to shift our focus to a new challenge: Raptors.\r\n\r\nThe Humans, while appreciative of the training Barnil and I offered, decided to refrain from hunting with firearms.  Ajeck was much more comfortable with a finely strung bow and Sir Erlgadin never left camp without his sturdy crossbow.",
					"We set out at first light, heading south past the Tkashi Ruins.  Barnil voiced concern that we might encounter members of the Bloodscalp Tribe.  I reminded Barnil that the Bloodscalps were more concerned with destroying their tribal enemy, the Skullsplitters.  Needless to say, Barnil was not comforted in the least.  I, however, had a loaded rifle, a satchel full of gunpowder and three deadly hunters with me to ease any concerns of an unfriendly ambush.",
					"I've stood before a towering Infernal on the battlefield, the army of the Burning Legion advancing from all directions.  An unruly band of Trolls seems as harmless as a jackrabbit in the hills of Dun Morogh.\r\n\r\nWe passed the Tkashi Ruins without event, much to Barnil's relief.  The party proceeded to head westward, toward the Great Sea, skirting the Ruins of Zul'Kunda just to the south.  As we ascended the high sea bluffs we spotted our first Raptor.",
					"The beast never so much as detected our presence.  In fact, the only greeting he received from the expedition was a bullet between the eyes.\r\n\r\nSir Erlgadin let out a hearty *hurrah* as Ajeck nodded toward me with keen approval.  I sifted through my pack in search of my pipe, hoping to enjoy a celebratory smoke.  Barnil began to scurry up the hillside to retrieve the Raptor's corpse.  I stared at the fallen beast with the satisfaction that accompanies every big kill.",
					"But I could not bask in the glory of the kill for long.  For when I turned my eyes toward the horizon, several silhouettes appeared cresting the hill, just above poor Barnil.\r\n\r\n*Flee, Barnil!* I shouted.  Ajeck, Sir Erlgadin and myself loosed a volley of bullets, arrows and bolts over Barnil and toward the pursuing raptors.  One of us landed a kill amidst the confusion.",
					"Our hastily aimed shots were enough to buy Barnil's escape.  Barnil clamored back down the hill and rejoined the party. We scurried off into the jungle; a pack of ferocious Lashtail Raptors stalking our every move.  \r\n\r\nThe hunters were now the hunted.",
					"I led the party toward the sea, hoping the shoreline would provide refuge from the Raptors.  In our haste we had drifted too far north, to a precariously high elevation.  The mistake was made.  The fault was mine.  We stopped just short of a sheer cliff, the Raptors just a few paces behind.",
					"I stepped slowly forward, gun raised.  I had led these brave hunters to their death.  I would die defending them.  Lashtail Raptors are particularly fierce, known for their unrelenting blood-thirst.  They far outnumbered us.  But I would be damned if I let them kill me and my comrades without shedding some of their own blood first.",
					"Ajeck and Sir Erlgadin readied their weapons, flanking me on either side, our backs to the sea.  Barnil let out a defeated sigh and drew his axe.  The Lashtails were almost upon us.  Their steady stride had slowed.  They were stalking their prey now for they knew they had us trapped.",
					"And then something miraculous happened.  From off to our side we heard the distinct and terrifying roar of the great white tiger.  Despite their numbers, the Raptors turned and scattered in all directions.  We saw but a brief white flash as the tiger darted past us and pounced on one of the Raptors.  No command needed to be given.  All four members of our party knew it was time to run.",
					"We sprinted all the way back to base camp, never slowing.  Later that night we sat quietly around the campfire, knowing our lives had been saved by a bizarre twist of fate.  Such are the risks of the big game hunter.  We toy with fate by delivering it.  Yet each of us, at some point, will face fate's razor sharp teeth.  This Dwarf is just glad that moment did not come upon the green hills of Stranglethorn.\r\n\r\n--The End--",

This fascinating bit of news would imply that there were societies older than that of our own on Azeroth.\n\nFrom what I could decipher, the Pools of Youth were actually the property of an ancient dynasty. What race comprised this dynasty still remains a mystery.\n\nThere is something sinister about the writings of this "Dojani dynasty" however. There are also references to an imperial seat and a valley of golden blossoms. \n\nThe choice bit of news is that they included coordinates to their kingdom\'s "heart of power."

Deems the mission "too risky." \n\nHow is the mortality of our people to be dismissed as "too risky"?

I can proceed.\n\nIt would seem her ladyship was beset by dreams and visions of the same golden valley I told her of in my research. \n\nFor her, the visions gave her a sense of healing and a need for peace. But her visions also had something about danger and "gets worse before it gets better" type of warnings. \n\nThe scrolls my research came from spoke of a peaceful land as well so I am not sure what she is so concerned about.',

Blinded with lies about hope, I left my wife and two young daughters at home whilst I scouted for Scourge presence in our area. Our petty band searched the woods for weeks, but every trail went cold. Winter set in and still we had learned nothing about the enemy. Frustrated, we turned homeward.",
					"Ascending the final hill revealed a terrifying vista. The village lay burnt and deformed. I ran to our house. A makeshift bolt had been nailed across the outside of the door. Too distressed to wonder at this, I burst in to find the remains of my family prostrate at my feet, charred beyond recognition. I turned away in anguish, and beheld the gashes in the door where they had clawed in panic. The smallest scratches had belonged to the youngest.",

They were an illusion, serving only to distract me from the reality of pain and dissolution. My daughters were dead and the field overrun with Scourge. Death is the only real end to any mortal tale. Wielding power to protect leads inalterably to failure. Success meets only those who use it for a different end...",

By now, Instructor Razuvious has likely begun teaching you the first lessons of what it means to be a death knight.  Allow me to begin your instruction on what is perhaps the most guarded treasure in a death knight's possession; the runeblade.\r\n\r\n",
					"Without your hand to guide it, your runeblade is but a hollow shell.  Separate, you are both broken entities; weak and powerless.  Should you ever find yourself without possession of a runeblade, know then that your only task should be the acquisition of another with all due haste.\r\n",

For just as you, young death knight are the extension through which the Lich King imposes his will, so is your runeblade the instrument that has been granted the honor in delivering this authority.  Of this authority, understand these principles:\r\n",
					"1.) United, your runeblade becomes an extension of your very body.  And your body belongs to the Lich King.\n\n\r\n2.) As one, your runeblade becomes your will manifest in physical form.  And your will is that of the Lich King.\n\n\r\n3.) Together, your runeblade becomes the vein through which death itself is delivered to your soul.  And your soul shall deliver the will of the Lich King. \r\n",
					"Through the course of your training, you may find yourself compelled to focus upon some of the different disciplines of study available to our kind.  On this matter I can only say this; all are worthy of study and to neglect some at the cost of others is a foolish pride that I have seen cost other, less capable death knights in battle their lives.\r\n",
					"It is likely that some of you may soon find your runeblade to be a particularly potent object through which to channel your own fury.  However, this is not enough.  Do not be content to believe that your runeblade is simply a mere tool to focus one's meditation.  No, it is far more than that.  The most powerful of our kind have been able to command the power of their blade with but a simple extension of their will.  Together they fight, of singular mind, body, and purpose to crush any foolish enough to stand in their way.\r\n",
					"Others may find that their blade responds most eagerly when infused with the power of an icy chill.  In this way, even the sharpest of runeblades will find themselves made even more potent.  The same power that permeates our glorious citadel of Icecrown is yours to command, death knight.  Should you choose to master this discipline, there shall be no escape for your enemies, as they find their actions slowed and made impossible by the cold.\r\n",
					"Still others may find their true calling in mastering the power of their blades to bring about disease and plague in crushing our enemies.  This too is a specialty unique to our kind and worthy of pursuit.  The mightiest of defenses may seem impregnable at first, yet for every defense therein lies the weakness that it is covering.  It is simply a matter of uncovering it.  Never forget, death knight, that it was not an army, but a plague that brought about the destruction of Lordaeron.\r\n",

She named him Lo, and they became fast friends.",
					"This was much to the lament of the common people. Serpents, you see, were feared as monsters and wild animals, both cunning and dangerous. The townsfolk shunned Jiang, and begged for her to get rid of Lo before he became old enough to hurt her.\n\nOne day, the Zandalari army had pushed as far south as the Jade Forest. Monsters from the sea, these trolls launched an attack against Pandaria. Jiang answered the call to arms, and defended her people on the beaches.",

Just as the weapon was inches from her heart, Lo came to the rescue.\n\nThe serpent, only half grown, swooped in and ripped the troll limb from limb.

These were the great warrior monks who defended the land from the trolls and other dangers.",

The monks were mired in their own wisdom, and chose to continue their defense in the way they sought fit. \n\nJiang did not give up though. This rejection only fueled her resolve.",
					"Several days later, the Zandalari had pushed in from the coast. It was on the great bridge near Dawn's Blossom that the pandaren champions stood their ground. With an effort they tried to hold back the trolls, and were losing. The Zandalari numbers were vast, and their bat riders fought in such a way the pandaren had no counter to. All hope of victory began to fade.",

				["text"] = {
					"The Decree of the Scourge\r\nChapter 1\r\nBy Kel'Thuzad\r\n\r\nThe roots of the Scourge are sewn in the folly of all races. Our rise to power is the product of the sins of those who mean our end. The so called 'heroes' of the land fall before us by resorting to a measure of our ideals to bring forth their envisioned victory. Their victory is a vehicle to the realization that without resorting to what they define as deplorability to achieve it, we would have overcome them instead. In both outcomes, win or lose, the Scourge invariably wins. When this is recognized, submission to our will is inevitable.\r\n",
					"The Master, our Lich King, was born under this very same doctrine.\r\n\r\nTo conquer is to corrupt. To corrupt is to take what it is to be righteous and hopeful, to be living, and invert it through any means in your arsenal. The attributes of the living all have synonyms with fatal flaws that are their undoing: hope is dogma, righteousness is zealotry, living is empathy. Recognize what makes that which lives desire to live, and turn it upon itself.\r\n",
					"Knowing the most direct path of corruption is the pinnacle of wisdom. A simple weakening of the heart, dismemberment of vital organs, or direct disease will work for most. However the conquer of most is not the decree of the Master, but the conquer of all. It is foolish to spend excessive resources in warping the mind of a simple peasant where common plague will suffice, but it is equally unwise to try the same common plague against the seasoned and hearty. Regimented study of any formidability will reveal useable weaknesses. \r\n",
					"The Decree of the Scourge\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\nThe largest misconception the living have of the Scourge is our penchant for what is considered 'evil.' For the sake of demoralization we allow this error to perpetuate, and indeed spread it on our own. The true nature of The Scourge is our transcendence of the shackles that keep any of the living races from becoming as prosperous as we. \r\n",
					"For example: What benefits do emotion and honor really hold? They serve to validate the living, to make them feel 'good.' Now, what flaws do they hold? Emotion is directly correlated to the ignorance of logic and reason. Honor is, at most times, the sole perpetuator of able resources fighting a losing battle. It is baffling even to me that the living can be so unaware of how eager we are to play the part of their villain, to nurture their greatest flaws by becoming the embodiment of all that incites irrational behavior.\r\n",
					"Moral ambiguity cannot be 'cleansed.' Antipathy cannot be 'healed' or 'assuaged.' Greed cannot be 'dispelled' and wrath cannot be 'cured.' We choose to be the embodiment of all these things, and yet there are some still foolish enough to believe that the Scourge can be defeated and removed completely. So long as the most attractive sins of the living remain our banner flag, there will always be those eager to flock to our will.  \r\n\r\nI myself was born under this doctrine.\r\n",
					"The Decree of the Scourge\r\nChapter 3\r\n\r\nThe Scourge is infinite in potential. We are not, however, infallible by any means. Always be well aware of your limits, and the resources at your disposal. Always have an exit strategy. Sacrifice of eager minions to your ends is a cornerstone of Scourge philosophy. All manner of bravery, martyrdom, or compatriotism for anyone but the Master is imprudent and severely punishable.\r\n\r\n",
					"Another fallacy outsiders hold of the Scourge is that our power resides in the residual will of the living, that we are an advanced form of parasite, and without a host of regenerating life would simply wither away. Again we do not deny such ignorant thought for our benefit, but this could not be further from the truth. We are nothing but an ever-improving form of adaptation to a land once riddled with endless struggle. We are immune to the tribulations of dissention, over-population, individuality, selfish opinion, short-sightedness, and even mortality. We hear the will of the Master, and the Master brings us all that we will ever desire. \r\n",
					"It is true that we take architecture, technology, and physical prowess from assimilated cultures. This, like the so many 'evil' acts of the Scourge, is done entirely out of pragmatism. The Scourge has neither the time nor the desire to generate a culture of its own. A member of the Scourge that creates without influence will hold an inherent attachment to it, a right to see it viewed and used. This leads to individuality, which leads to dissention. Creativity is a flaw of culture, but a minor obligation when dealing with simple needs like buildings and equipment. It is not your duty to question or care of the origins of your resources, only in how usable they are.\r\n",
					"The Scourge is the will of the land. All manner of life kneel to our will with an ease that yields a single conclusion: That they need us, they yearn for our salvation. There is no resilience to our practices, no immunity to our commandments. We are every bit the inevitability that a natural life holds: Death. Death comes with every life, and undeath comes with every death. The sooner the living recognizes this immutable fact, the easier their transition will be.\r\n",

I managed to complete a sending and contact a couple of the other apprentices who are trapped in their rooms. Through them I was able to learn what has the citadel on high alert. The masters are organizing search parties to locate the necromancer who was responsible for animating the corpses of the diseased farmers.\r\n",

					"We have resumed our efforts to learn more about the disease. Work has been slow due to most of the bodies having been obliterated. The masters have called in Lady Jaina Proudmoore to aid in our research. She will teleport here by the end of the day. I hear she is quite beautiful; hopefully working with Lady Proudmoore with help me keep my mind off of this damned cold.\r\n",

With trembling hands, the Emperor donned the horrific mask, so as to draw forth his own fears..."\n\nThe battle against the Sha of Fear lasted a week and a day, during which time legend has it that the sun never rose.

This is the kind of trick you can only fail once.",

The ever-popular slow fall spell is an excellent alternative to falling to your death (and much more reliable than Blink at this function). More advanced practitioners of the arcane arts can also learn a spell that slows the movements of their enemies. I've heard rumors of a spell that increases movement speed as well, but I've never seen it in practice.",

The Sundering that shattered the world nearly sunk the mountain into the sea, but perhaps the last emperor thought that it was worth saving. Or maybe he feared the mountain's secret so much that he wanted to hide it away. Like the rest of Pandaria, the mountaintop city - now an island - was hidden away in the mists.",

Desperately, he called out to the Jade Serpent for help.\n\nThe Jade Serpent circled the Vale, and spoke to the beleaguered Emperor. "Pandaria is more than just the Pandaren Empire," she told Shaohao. "Your enemies to the west are as much a part of this land as your empire behind the wall."',
					"Seeing that all things were connected in an eternal whole, and that his beloved land was more than just the Pandaren Empire, Shaohao at last understood. His staff clattered to the floor as his spirit became one with the land. When the world tore itself apart, Pandaria drifted quietly into the ocean. And as the Emperor's robes fluttered empty to the ground, the land became enveloped in impenetrable mists, hidden away from the rest of the world.",

					"A small group of workers from an outlying farm near Andorhal were brought in this morning and taken to the infirmary within the Violet Citadel. I do not know much about what ails them but I overheard one of them complaining about weakness and nausea. I hope the masters choose me to aid them in working to treat the farmers.",
					"2 hours later\r\n\r\nWhat luck!  One of the masters informed me that I will be working with the men who were brought in from Andorhal earlier. I intend to make good use of this opportunity to show how far I have come in my studies.\r\n",
					"6 hours later\r\n\r\nThis is not turning out to be quite as glorious as I had planned. The farmers' conditions have deteriorated quickly in their short time here. One has developed irritated boils covering large portions of his skin. I have treated the most seriously afflicted with some of the most powerful herbs and poultices available in the citadel. There should be some noticeable improvement within the next few hours.\r\n",
					"10 hours later\r\n\r\nThe situation has quickly gotten out of control.  All of the subjects are now covered in lesions which leak yellow-green fluid. All but a few are unconscious at this point. The few that are awake alternate between complaints of paralyzing numbness and burning aches in their joints. All of the subjects are showing a milky coloring in their eyes.\r\n",
					"Our attempts to slow the progress of the illness have been unsuccessful. Word has spread among the apprentices that this disease may be magical in nature; the masters were quick to quash the rumors. Many of the other apprentices that I had been working with on this project have excused themselves for fear that the disease is contagious and capable of penetrating our personal wards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

All attempts to halt the progress of the disease have failed. I have done what I can to ease their pain. I only hope that we can learn what we need from them after their deaths. No one should suffer as these men have suffered. I plan to stay with them until the end.\r\n",
					"To make matters worse one of the guards found the body of a first year apprentice in the gardens. It has not been confirmed yet but the rumors are that he froze to death. I do not think it has been this cold here in Dalaran in decades, if ever.\r\n",
					"18 hours later\r\n\r\nThe farmers from Andoral are dead. I thought they would finally be at peace but I was wrong. Only a few minutes after the last one breathed his last breath something horrifying happened. Their disease riddled corpses somehow animated and began clawing at myself and the other mages in the infirmary. Once the initial confusion passed one of the masters organized a force to deal with the animated bodies. The undead quickly fell to our combined arcane might.\r\n",
					"There were minimal casualties. A few of the apprentices had been scratched; one had a nasty bite that required stitches. Shortly afterward guards arrived and escorted myself and the other apprentices to our rooms. I tried to learn what was going on but they would not answer me. As we were being led through the halls to our rooms we passed by several troupes of guards with weapons drawn and readied. Is this what war feels like?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
					"After I was brought to my room I was told to lock the door and not come out until I was told by a master personally that it was safe to leave. What is going on?  Has the world gone mad?",
					"24 hours later\r\n\r\nI have been awake for over twenty-four hours now. I am exhausted but my room is too cold to sleep. I managed to complete a sending and contact a couple of the other apprentices who are trapped in their rooms. Through them I was able to learn what has the citadel on high alert. The masters are organizing search parties to locate the necromancer who was responsible for animating the corpses of the diseased farmers.\r\n",
					"There has not been a practicing necromancer in Dalaran since Kel'Thuzad. I hope the monster responsible for the horrors I have seen today is brought to justice soon.\r\n",
					"38 hours later\r\n\r\nThe quarantine has been lifted and we apprentices are finally allowed to leave our rooms. The necromancer responsible for animating the dead farmers was never caught but the masters are confident that he is not within the citadel or anywhere near Dalaran. \r\n",
					"We have resumed our efforts to learn more about the disease. Work has been slow due to most of the bodies having been obliterated. The masters have called in Lady Jaina Proudmoore to aid in our research. She will teleport here by the end of the day. I hear she is quite beautiful; hopefully working with Lady Proudmoore with help me keep my mind off of this damned cold.\r\n",

Perhaps the most iconic Transmutation spell is Polymorph, which allows a mage to turn something - or someone - into something else. Fortunately for many of my students, the effects are not permanent. I've seen more than one unwary apprentice turned into a sheep, pig, or worse - don't even ask what 'worse' means.",

Blink can be used to quickly escape a foe - or save a mage who has accidentally fallen off a cliff. Do not attempt to use blink to escape falling to your death unless absolutely necessary. This is the kind of trick you can only fail once.",

There's a reason we have very specific spells to teleport to certain locations - attempts to cast a teleportation 'on the fly' often result in one very dead mage inside a wall, chair, or another mage. And I don't mean in a fun way.",

The ever-popular slow fall spell is an excellent alternative to falling to your death (and much more reliable than Blink at this function).

I've heard rumors of a spell that increases movement speed as well, but I've never seen it in practice.",

It was as if she was searching for a thought. Once more a great percussive sound echoed out across the caverns. But this was no cannon fire.',
					'It was a sneeze. A huge, snot-filled sneeze. The kind whose aftermath commands everyone\'s embarrassed attention. It looked as if the captain had been attacked by a mucous monster from Beledar\'s Shadow, or the kobyss had tried to reanimate her with their goo-based magic. Lancekat\'s eyes shot daggers at her valiant crew she had just been about to praise.\r\n\r\n"Who brought a filthy thing aboard my ship?" she said, quietly but firmly as she furiously wiped away the goo. "Show me the vile beast." Captain Lancekat growled before loudly sniffling.',
					'Ensign Braenard held up a tiny Imperial Lynx, barely three months old. "It bonded to me last shore leave in Mereldar, ma\'am. I couldn\'t just leave her."\r\n\r\nAs the ensign and the kitten were lowered down at the nearest Arathi outpost, a dark cave filled with emergency rations, the bosun apologetically shouted, "The Captain, she\'s the best in the armada! But her allergies, they\'re worse than any nerubian shadow curse!"',

One was the Fist of Ra-den, a weapon infused with the destructive might of storms. The other was the Highkeeper\'s Ward, a shield pulsing with the primordial elements of fire, earth, air, and water.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nNo one has successfully wielded these armaments since they passed from Ra\'s care. Even Lei Shen, Thunder King and emperor of the mogu, could not. Will you succeed where he failed?\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Fist of Ra-den, Part One</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nIt is known that the titan Aman\'Thul crafted the Fist of Ra-den. How he did so is another question.\r\n<BR/><BR/> \r\nAccording to one legend, Aman\'Thul called on mysterious celestial beings to forge an instrument that would hold sway over the power of storms. These creatures reached into Azeroth\'s sky and took a single bolt of lightning, which they shaped with their hands as if it were mere clay. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nWhen the craftsmen had finished their work, Aman\'Thul encased the captured lightning in stone and branded the rock with titan runes of containment.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Fist of Ra-den, Part Two</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAman\'Thul gave his lightning-infused weapon to Ra, one of the legendary titan-forged. These stone- and iron-skinned giants were created by the titans to liberate Azeroth from the Old Gods.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe Old Gods were immensely powerful, and their minions were beyond count. But never for a moment did Ra and his allies hesitate. Under the guidance of Aman\'Thul and the other titans, the noble giants defeated the Old Gods and shackled them in prisons buried deep under the earth.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nRa accomplished many feats during this war. He wielded lightning with the lethal accuracy of a blade, carving through the Old Gods\' servants and reducing them to cinders. There was only one enemy who matched Ra\'s command over storms: the cunning elemental lord known as Al\'Akir.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

All the while, Al\'Akir boasted of his coming victory, but his words were as empty as air.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"True, he was great and powerful. True, he could command the storms. But he did not breathe thunder and speak lightning as Master Ra did. He did not wield the fist that breaks the sky.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"Master Ra and his kin turned Al\'Akir\'s own tempests against him until the Windlord faltered. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"To seal Al\'Akir\'s demise, Master Ra slammed his fist into the mountaintop. The heavens split wide, and all the fire and fury they contained crashed down atop the Windlord\'s head."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Fist of Ra-den, Part Four</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAn excerpt from The Banishing of the Elemental Lords, by the historian Llore:\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"The elemental lords served as the Old Gods\' greatest lieutenants, and the titan-forged had defeated them all. The victory was momentous, but it also presented a unique challenge. The spirits of the elemental lords were bound to Azeroth. If the titan-forged destroyed them, they would eventually manifest on the world again. To prevent this, Highkeeper Ra decided to imprison the destructive beings. \r\n<BR/><BR/>"He worked alongside the titan-forged sorceress Helya to create a pocket dimension that would be known as the Elemental Plane. It included four domains, representing the four elements: fire, air, earth, and water. Into this prison realm, Ra and Helya banished the elemental lords and almost all of their servants.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"Ra and Helya crafted a shield, the Highkeeper\'s Ward, to act as a key to the Elemental Plane. It thrummed with the energies of the four elements, which Ra could call upon whenever he desired."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Fist of Ra-den, Part Five</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAfter the Old Gods were defeated, Ra and his allies created new kinds of titan-forged to protect and reshape Azeroth. Among them were the mighty stone-skinned mogu. Led by Ra, they journeyed to the southern reaches of the world and began their long guardianship. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAman\'Thul and his fellow titans closely watched these events unfold. Confident that Azeroth was safe in the hands of their servants, they eventually departed the world.\r\n<BR/><BR/>On a stormy day, Ra and his mogu followers ascended a colossal mountain to see the titans off. The legends say that the Highkeeper slammed his weapon against his shield, and the elements answered to his will. The rains ceased and the clouds parted. The mountain at their feet rose higher, and lightning and fire illuminated the skies so that Ra and his followers could better glimpse the titans. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nLastly, the winds howled a sorrowful farewell.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Fist of Ra-den, Part Six</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAn excerpt from The Rise of the Thunder King, by the historian Llore:\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"Many ages after the titans left Azeroth, a strange affliction called the curse of flesh took hold among the mogu. It weakened their stone forms and transformed them into creatures of flesh and blood. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"The mogu fragmented into warring clans. For years upon years, they fought each other for control of Azeroth\'s southern lands. From this crucible of violence, one mogu emerged and forged his people into an empire.\r\n<BR/><BR/>"His name was Lei Shen, the Thunder King, and his strength was without equal. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"Many tales exist about how Lei Shen acquired his power. The most widely accepted theory is that he stole it from a legendary being named Ra-den, which means "Master Ra" in the mogu tongue.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"But what of this creature\'s fabled artifacts, the Fist of Ra-den and the Highkeeper\'s Ward? Surely, Lei Shen would have taken them as well, but there is very little mention of the Thunder King using them."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Fist of Ra-den, Part Seven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nFor all his might, Lei Shen could not harness the energies of the Fist of Ra-den and the Highkeeper\'s Ward. His inability to do so infuriated him. After all, Lei Shen had conquered the mogu and forged them into an empire. He had defeated Ra. How could two artifacts defy his will?\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut defy him they did. The shield and the fist weapon were simply too much even for the Thunder King to control. Every time he tried to use the artifacts, elemental energies lashed out at Lei Shen and overwhelmed him.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nDespite these repeated failures, Lei Shen did not give up. One way or another, he would harness the power of these ancient weapons.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Fist of Ra-den, Part Eight</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nLei Shen gave the Fist of Ra-den and the Highkeeper\'s Ward to a gifted blacksmith, Forgemaster Deng. The Thunder King ordered him to unlock the artifacts\' secrets, but he also warned the artisan not to harness their power for himself, or he would suffer grave consequences.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nDeng promised Lei Shen that he would follow his command, but he secretly plotted to disobey his master. The blacksmith reasoned that if he could find a way to use the weapon and the shield, something the Thunder King had been unable to do, he could take control over the mogu empire himself.\r\n<BR/><BR/>While Deng was tampering with the Fist of Ra-den, a bolt of lightning tore down from the sky and slammed into him. The artifact absorbed most of the energy, which saved the blacksmith\'s life. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut Deng did not escape unharmed. The lightning left him forever disfigured.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Fist of Ra-den, Part Nine</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAfter much experimentation, Deng found a purpose for the Fist of Ra-den and the Highkeeper\'s Ward. He used the two artifacts to power an immense engine known as the Thunder Forge. This machine churned day and night, creating armaments of exceptional quality for the mogu military.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nLei Shen was pleased by the work, and he ordered Deng to personally craft him weapons and armor that would put all others to shame. The blacksmith toiled over the Thunder Forge to satisfy his master. Deng\'s labors gave rise to what would be his three greatest creations: a massive spear, a battleaxe, and a mighty helm.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Fist of Ra-den, Part Ten</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nIn time, Deng and Lei Shen died. The mogu empire crumbled. Seasons passed. The world changed.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nA race known as the pandaren came to power in the lands once lorded over by the mogu. The new rulers governed with wisdom and benevolence, unlike Lei Shen and his brutal kin. Under the pandaren, an era of relative peace and prosperity settled over the region. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThousands of years after the fall of the mogu empire, a group of pandaren guardians called the Shado-Pan discovered the artifacts that had powered the Thunder Forge. These explorers were led by Master Wan Snowdrift, who was unaware of the dangerous energies stored in the items he had found.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSnowdrift took up the Fist of Ra-den, and he was immediately struck by a spear of lightning that seared his flesh and scarred his body.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Fist of Ra-den, Part Eleven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThough he was injured, Master Wan Snowdrift survived his encounter with the Fist of Ra-den. He and the other Shado-Pan feared that the weapon and its counterpart shield could do grave harm to the world if they fell into the wrong hands. To prevent this, they took the artifacts to Xuen, the White Tiger.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe White Tiger was one of the August Celestials, ancient and incredibly powerful creatures revered by the pandaren. Wise Xuen agreed with the Shado-Pan\'s assessment of the weapon and the shield. He secured them within his lair, the Temple of the White Tiger, where they would be safe.\r\n<BR/><BR/>Yet Xuen did not plan to keep them there forever. He knew the history of the artifacts. Though the mogu had used them for evil, the titan Aman\'Thul had originally created them for good. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nXuen believed it was only a matter of time before a mortal arrived who was fit to wield the weapon and the shield for their intended purpose.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

When a mighty storm forced him to take shelter in a Gorgrond steam cavern, Gelnar experienced fever-induced visions. Pledging his body and spirit to the elements, he submerged himself in a pool of lava and was miraculously unharmed. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAccording to legend, the head of the Doomhammer was coaxed forth from the heart of Draenor itself. When Gelnar later crafted an oaken handle, the forming of the Doomhammer was complete.

The chain was temporarily broken when a young Orgrim Doomhammer took the weapon to the lava pool where it had been created. There, he attempted to negate the prophecy associated with it, while retaining the hammer\'s power.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe pool reclaimed the weapon from Orgrim. It remained in the lava until an orc chieftain, clearing his mind of pride and dreams of glory, reached in and took the Doomhammer in his grasp. Though the lava left him permanently scarred, the chieftain did not die. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nFrom that day forward, that chieftain would be known as Blackhand. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBlackhand used the Doomhammer to forge weapons and help fight off an invading ogre army.

He would find that comrade in an orc raised by humans--Thrall. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nUpon first meeting the hooded Orgrim, Thrall was unaware of the stranger\'s identity. When Thrall challenged him to a fight at the camp of the Frostwolves, the former chieftain accepted. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThrall quickly proved his mettle, trading blows with the armored combatant, grappling with him, and at one point, successfully wrenching the Doomhammer from the other orc\'s grasp. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBy the end of the bout, Orgrim was so pleased with his opponent\'s tenacity that he named Thrall his second-in-command.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

However, following his execution of the malign warchief Garrosh Hellscream, Thrall felt conflicted. This internal struggle was reflected in the Doomhammer as well. In Thrall\'s mind, the weapon that had embodied the ideals of justice and virtue had now come to represent vengeance.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nHistory repeated itself as the Doomhammer had once again become a "dead weight."

They devoted themselves to plumbing the Well of Eternity\'s depths in search of knowledge and power.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nPerhaps no one was more suited to this task than Azshara.

As masons constructed the temple, Azshara shaped the waters around it with the Scepter of Tides. She spoke the names of the rivers and the seas, and they moved at her command.

She used her scepter to make him perform tricks and feats of strength, much to the delight of the watching Highborne. Curious night elves from the far corners of the empire journeyed to Lathar\'Lazal to study the mythical creature and his habits."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

She obsessed over the lake and used Sharas\'dal to manipulate its mysterious energies. Azshara dreamed of making the world into a paradise--her paradise. But it would only be possible if she and her Highborne servitors could harness the Well of Eternity\'s true potential.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nTheir reckless experiments eventually sent arcane magic crashing through the Twisting Nether, the realm of demons. In time, the Burning Legion learned of the Well of Eternity and the world of Azeroth.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

The queen forged a pact with him for unfathomable power. All that Sargeras asked in return was for Azshara and her Highborne to summon his minions into Azeroth.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"It was a difficult request, even for such gifted sorcerers. Azshara and the Highborne approached the challenge with great fervor. Legends say the queen helped her servants open a gateway for the Legion\'s agents. She used Sharas\'dal to gather the Well of Eternity\'s energies and fuel the Highborne\'s spellwork. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"Through this portal, the first armor-clad demons spilled into Azeroth. Many more would follow. The Legion would march across the land, spreading fire and death, bringing war and cataclysm."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

Azshara\'s hubris and abuse of power would lead to the destruction of the Well of Eternity. The enormous lake buckled in upon itself, eventually igniting a monstrous explosion that shattered the world\'s surface.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAzshara watched these events unfold from her broken palace. She refused to believe that her dreams of paradise were dead, that the world she had once cradled in her palms was coming apart beneath her feet. Many of the Highborne were just as delusional as the queen, and they remained at her side.\r\n<BR/><BR/>As the ocean roared in to fill the void left by the destroyed Well of Eternity, Azshara raised Sharas\'dal high. She wove a magical shield around herself and the Highborne, saving them from being crushed by the colossal waves. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut it was only a momentary reprieve. The howling ocean soon swallowed the queen, Sharas\'dal, and her followers. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThen it sucked them down and down into darkness.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

It did.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"Azshara\'s and the Highborne\'s blood ran cold, and so the queen willed Sharas\'dal to warm them. It did.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"Their lungs burned for air, and so the queen willed Sharas\'dal to let them breathe the water... but it did not. The scepter could not save them. Oblivion spread its arms and beckoned the desperate Highborne.\r\n<BR/><BR/>"As the ocean crushed the life from their bodies, ancient creatures stirred in the darkness. Their whispers flowed through the currents. Their powers wrapped tight around the queen and her servants. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"The Highborne became something new. Something more. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"A fleece of scales shimmered over their skin. Tails thrashed against the currents.

The queen and her naga servants created a capital, Nazjatar, at the bottom of the sea. With patience and cunning, they expanded their dominion over the oceans. It is even said that Azshara nurtured an alliance with the mysterious and powerful entities who had transformed them into naga.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAs the years wore on, Azshara relied on Sharas\'dal less and less. She still treasured the scepter, but she found it was more useful in the hands of her fearsome sea witches.

With a swipe of the scepter, they drove thousands of aquatic predators into a frenzy and unleashed them against troublesome sea giants. With a whispered incantation, they boiled Kvaldir raiders from the inside out and scattered their remains to the currents. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nWhen the sea witches were not wielding Sharas\'dal, Azshara would often carry it at her side and reminisce about times long past. She still remembered Lord Xavius\'s promise: so long as she kept the scepter close, it would bring her prosperity and great power. \r\n<BR/><BR/>The queen had lost much, but she was not dead. Far from it. In her heart, she knew that one day her empire under the sea would eclipse even that of the ancient night elves. One day, the world would be hers again, and she would not let it slip through her fingers a second time.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

					"My father called the stone the Dream of Argus, though I've come to understand it has been known by other names in the past. It was a crystal of great power, capable of sustaining an entire village on its energy alone. Some say that it was a gift passed on to our family by the naaru during the exodus from Argus - a connection that would explain its fabled power. \r\n\r\nSuch speculation is for naught, however, since the crystal has been broken for as long as I can remember. The Shards of the Dream, as I call them, appear as powerless as any of the latent crystals found in the deep mines of Shadowmoon. I continue to seek a means of rejoining them in hopes that one day the Dream of Argus can be reborn, and that the draenei people could use it to flourish on our home of Draenor.",
					"On a prospecting mission with some of the local Rangari, we happened upon a small enclave of Shadowmoon orcs, who were investigating the same mineral deposits. In idle discussion, the orcs spoke of rituals that they use to fuse smaller crystals together into large structures that can be stored with magical energy. I had never held previous interest in the Shadowmoon orcs' strange magics, but it seems it may hold the key to restoring the Dream of Argus.\r\n\r\nI must investigate this further.",
					"The prelate council has denied my request for an envoy to be sent to the Shadowmoon orcs. They believe such an investigation to be folly, and that I am simply desperate to restore a broken relic. They cannot force me to stay, however. \r\n\r\nOn the morrow I will strike out on my own, in hopes that the Shadowmoon will be willing to assist me in my efforts.",
					"I have travelled for days and have yet to come upon an orc of the Shadowmoon clan. Though there had been a noticeable lapse in trade with the orcs, we were unaware at how reclusive they had become recently. \r\n\r\nIt is clear that I must make the perilous trek up the western cliffs. I can see the massive stone monoliths carved with the runes of their clan looming above the plateaus. I must seek the Shadowmoon there.",
					"It appears that the Shadowmoon have withdrawn into their fortifications, though for what reason I am unsure. As I reached the top of the cliffs, I could see the members of their clan gathered in numbers I have never seen before in one place. \r\n\r\nThe orcs acted strange, however they were not unfriendly. They called this place the Pillars of Fate, and it appeared as if they were readying some great magical rituals. When questioning about the purpose of the rituals, or the recent reclusiveness of their clan, the orcs only offered cryptic responses.",
					"They did seem to be willing to discuss their methods of crystal reconstruction. An orc that was tending to some crystal structure of unknown purpose directed me to one called Lor Stonefist. She was a warrior of the Shadowmoon, as I understood it, and showed a particular affinity for the crystals native to the land.\r\n\r\nI was told she spent most of her time in the crystal cave to the north of the encampment. There she studied the native crystals for ways to improve their potential abilities. I will seek her there.",
					"Stonefist was a tall and imposing woman. Her brutish features belied her intelligence, and I was quite surprised at how knowledgeable she was when we discussed the restoration of the crystal. She boasted that with the help of the Shadowmoon's magics, she could recombine any crystal to be as flawless as it would have been in nature.  \r\n\r\nI would need to enlist the help of two other orcs in the camp in order to accomplish this: Vok Blacktongue and Koros Soulsplinter.",
					"Blacktongue, was a high ritualist of Shadowmoon, and a master runecarver. The ritual required a precise arrangement of runes, and due to the unique nature of my crystal we would require the work of an expert. She mentioned that the orc could normally found in one of the runemaster's huts in the southern part of the camp. They could be identified by the standing stones surrounding the structure, as well as the floating runestones above.\r\n\r\nThe other, Koros Soulsplinter, may be more difficult to locate. A reclusive hermit, Soulsplinter preferred to spend his time out of sight of the living. It is said, however, that he can often be seen among the graves upon the high hill, overlooking the camp below.  There he would commune with the dead ancestors, whom it is said he preferred over his living brethren.",
					"I have managed to locate the two orcs, and they have agreed to assist myself and Stonefist.  I will admit that their magic is strange to me, but I am mostly ignorant of these things. If their magic will help in restoring the Dream of Argus, then it is far from me to question it.\r\n\r\nWe located an empty cave on a terrace overlooking the Shadowmoon's great keep, Anguish Fortress, and under the instruction of Stonefist, I began constructing an altar. With the combined knowledge of draenei artificing and Shadowmoon mystic rune carving, we should be able to create a device capable of combining any crystal into its original form. \r\n\r\nThe Dream of Argus will be reborn!",
					"Construction continues on the altar device, however my allies appear to be growing restless. Some unknown force is stirring among the Shadowmoon, and they grow more hostile by the day. The orcs assisting me constantly argue in their language that I do not understand, and I fear they may not wish to help me much longer.\r\n\r\nI will continue to work, despite the growing tension. The fate of the draenei may very well rest on this crystal.",
					"The device is nearly complete, though I am growing concerned with my presence among the Shadowmoon. The clan seem to be mobilizing an army, and I can see their sorcerers conjuring foul beings from the forbidden realms. I am beginning to feel like a prisoner here among the pillars.\r\n\r\nI can only hope that the Shadowmoon will let me return to the draenei once my mission is complete.",
					"I have been betrayed. We had completed the device, but before I was able to activate it and restore the crystal, the orcs turned on me. Stonefist stuck the blow, which left me broken and useless at the foot of the device. I could only watch as each orc took a piece of the crystal for themselves before I was dragged away. \r\n\r\nI now sit chained to the base of a heavy runestone, awaiting my fate. My only wish now is to see my people again one last time.",

					"Chapter 1 - The Front Line\r\n\r\nDismantling the Stormpike army is very much like peeling an onion. To get to the core, you must start by removing the outermost layers.\r\n\r\nThe front lines, comprised mostly of Stormpike Mountaineers and Alliance Sentinels, are tied to the Captain's bunker. It is Captain Balinda Stonehearth who empowers these units and provides for reinforcements when the lines are under siege. Strike at the Captain and the front line forces will crumble.\r\n\r\n",
					"Chapter 2 - The Twin Towers\r\n\r\nMake no mistake; Vanndar Stormpike is a cunning foe and certainly no fool. Once the front line has been breached, the secondary defensive targets must still be destroyed. It is the twin towers of Stonehearth and Icewing which control the Stormpike Guardsmen outside of Dun Baldar and the Stormpike patrols.",
					"Beware, soldier, as both of these towers are heavily fortified and ruled over by one of Vanndar's elite Commanders. Should your forces breach the fortifications, make certain that the Commander within has been ... silenced. This too will be part of the dismantling of the Stormpike.\r\n",
					"Chapter 3 - The Four Commanders\r\n\r\nThe third layer of the Stormpike onion is comprised of the four Commanders. In this respect, Vanndar has mimicked our own glorious Frostwolf defenses. Of course he will tell you otherwise... But I digress. \r\n\r\nThe four Commanders control the ebb and flow of the Stormpike Guardsmen that fiercely guard Dun Baldar. Silence them all and the Stormpike Guardsmen will fall. \r\n\r\nThen there is but one layer left to peel.\r\n",
					"Chapter 4 - The Dun Baldar Bunkers\r\n\r\nAs you have undoubtedly noticed, the Stormpike defensive layers are in place to prevent one mighty power move from dismantling the entire army. Before you ask, yes, this is exactly how our own forces are setup and no, I will not change our defensive structure. They copied us, why should we have to change?\r\n",

Some of Azeroth\'s mightiest spellcasters used Ebonchill to hunt down and vanquish the Burning Legion\'s wicked agents. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nWhen the Legion stole Ebonchill, the tradition put in place by Alodi was broken... but only for a time. Now, in your hands, the greatstaff can once again fulfill its purpose to safeguard Azeroth.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ebonchill, Part One</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe tale of Ebonchill begins with a half-elf $PLAYER_CLASS$ named Alodi. Though he did not create the staff, he made it into the legendary weapon it is today.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAlodi never knew his real parents. From infancy, he was raised in an orphanage for magically gifted children in Dalaran. His only connection to his parents was Ebonchill, which they had left with the boy when they abandoned him at the school.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nHis dubious parentage and mixed ancestry made life difficult for Alodi. Most magi pitied him, but others treated him with scorn. No one believed he would rise to greatness. They were mistaken.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIn time, the orphan would become the first Guardian of Tirisfal, one of the most powerful magi to have ever lived.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ebonchill, Part Two</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAlodi became Guardian at a dire time for the Council of Tirisfal. This secret order of magi was created to protect Azeroth from demons. For many years, its members succeeded in their quest.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThen a dreadlord named Kathra\'natir changed everything. The demon infiltrated Dalaran and thwarted the council\'s attempts to stop him. Kathra\'natir sowed unrest in the streets, threatening to engulf the city in turmoil.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nTo defeat Kathra\'natir, the Council of Tirisfal\'s magi took drastic measures. Through a complex ritual, they infused all of their power into Alodi. It was an act of great trust and faith.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nKathra\'natir was no match for the newly empowered Alodi. The Guardian unleashed his astonishing power on the demon and banished him from the world in short order.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ebonchill, Part Three</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nFrom his early days in the Dalaran orphanage, Alodi had been fascinated with frost magic. This was due in part to the icy enchantments woven into Ebonchill. With the staff, Alodi learned how to freeze water and manipulate air temperature, often to the chagrin of the orphanage headmaster.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nShortly after Alodi became Guardian, he honed his mastery of frost magic and imbued Ebonchill with his own powers. A wintry aura enveloped the staff. Much to the astonishment of Alodi\'s companions on the Council of Tirisfal, the weapon never felt cold to the touch. Ebonchill contained only a sliver of Alodi\'s might, but even that was more than most magi could ever hope of wielding.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ebonchill, Part Four</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nDuring Alodi\'s tenure as Guardian, he used Ebonchill to hunt down every demon that stalked the lands of Azeroth. Many records tell of him calling down vicious ice storms to overwhelm his enemies, or encasing the Legion\'s agents in solid blocks of ice before exiling them from the world.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nNear the end of Alodi\'s one hundred years of service as Guardian, he turned his attention to his apprentices. He had trained and tutored many young magi in the ways of the arcane. They had become the family that he had never had, and he treated them all as his own sons and daughters.\r\n<BR/><BR/>Alodi decided to pass on Ebonchill to one of these learned apprentices. He did not choose the most powerful. More important to Alodi were compassion, wisdom, and comradery. After much consideration, he entrusted his greatstaff to the apprentice who most embodied these traits.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSo began a tradition of bequeathing Ebonchill that would endure for millennia.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ebonchill, Part Five</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAll was well with the Council of Tirisfal until the rise of Guardian Aegwynn. The gifted $PLAYER_CLASS$ grew suspicious of the order. She believed that the council was abusing its power by manipulating the politics of human kingdoms. At the end of her one hundred years of service, she refused to step down as Guardian.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAegwynn\'s disobedience eventually forced the council\'s hand. It formed the Tirisgarde, a group of talented magi charged with hunting down and subduing the wayward Guardian. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAmong the Tirisgarde was a promising but arrogant young spellcaster named Tarthen. His aging master had long ago inherited Ebonchill, and he was in the process of choosing which apprentice would take it up next.\r\n<BR/><BR/>Tarthen fully expected to receive the greatstaff. He eclipsed his fellow apprentices in raw power and potential. But Tarthen\'s master put little weight in such things. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nWhen the day of the ceremony came, the elderly $PLAYER_CLASS$ gave Ebonchill to another apprentice--one who embodied the qualities of compassion, wisdom, and comradery.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ebonchill, Part Six</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAfter his master passed on Ebonchill to a different apprentice, Tarthen wallowed in anger and bitterness. He believed he had been wronged, and he was determined to prove himself.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nTarthen stole Ebonchill from its new owner, taking great care to cover up evidence of his crime. In secret, he practiced with the greatstaff and learned to wield its extraordinary energies. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nOnly a handful of Tarthen\'s most trusted Tirisgarde allies knew of his theft. They alone witnessed him bending Ebonchill\'s magics to his will, and they were in awe of the power at his fingertips. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nOnce he was confident he had mastered Ebonchill, Tarthen set out to do what no other Tirisgarde had thus far managed--he would defeat Aegwynn and forever etch his name in the histories.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ebonchill, Part Seven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAn excerpt from a missive sent to the Council of Tirisfal:\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"We have studied the residual magics at the battle site. Here is our assessment of what transpired.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"Tarthen confronted Aegwynn in Stranglethorn Vale. In terms of the power used by the two magi, the duel that ensued was one of the greatest to have ever occurred between a Tirisgarde and the renegade Guardian. But it was also one of the shortest. \r\n<BR/><BR/>"Tarthen bore Ebonchill in battle--the greatstaff reported stolen some months ago. When he unleashed the weapon\'s stored power on Aegwynn, she immediately turned the energies back on him with a counterspell. A storm of frost magic surged over Tarthen, encasing him in a layer of diamond-hard ice.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"Despite the hot weather in the region, Tarthen was still frozen solid when we found him. It took considerable effort to thaw his corpse and free Ebonchill from his lifeless hand."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ebonchill, Part Eight</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe Council of Tirisfal magi who recovered Ebonchill returned the greatstaff to its owner. Over the following years, the tradition of handing down the weapon from master to apprentice continued. Many of these magi used Ebonchill to protect Azeroth from demons, but not the human named Arrexis.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nArrexis was a lover of knowledge. For days on end, he would lock himself in his personal archives, poring over ancient tomes and scrolls. When Ebonchill passed to him, he decided to study the greatstaff rather than wield it in battle. Arrexis knew well the weapon\'s history and deadly potential. \r\n<BR/><BR/>From his examinations, Arrexis believed that he could employ Ebonchill as a catalyst to power great spells--feats of magic that normally only a Guardian would be capable of. Over time, he harnessed the weapon\'s energies and used them to research new types of warding spells.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ebonchill, Part Nine</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nArrexis lived in a time of upheaval and turmoil for the Council of Tirisfal. The current Guardian was named Medivh, and he was the son of Aegwynn. Like his rebellious mother, he shunned the council and largely kept to himself. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nUnbeknownst to the council and the rest of the world, a great evil stirred in Medivh\'s soul. Sargeras, leader of the Burning Legion, had possessed the Guardian.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nDue to Sargeras\'s manipulation, Medivh forged a pact with the orcish Horde and began paving the way for its invasion of Azeroth. To prevent the Council of Tirisfal from meddling in his affairs, the darkened Guardian secretly assassinated some of its members.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nMedivh\'s gaze soon fell upon Arrexis and Ebonchill.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ebonchill, Part Ten</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nIn pursuit of his studies, Arrexis gathered his apprentice magi and established a research camp near Medivh\'s domain, the tower of Karazhan. The structure was built atop a nexus of potent ley lines. The energies that coursed through Karazhan sometimes warped reality in the region.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nArrexis and his followers experimented with their warding magics outside Karazhan, attempting to neutralize the tower\'s strange powers. The records indicate that Guardian Medivh visited the magi at this time and offered his advice. He suggested that Arrexis could apply his warding spellwork in new ways, specifically to prevent demons from clawing into the world.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThough some members of the Council of Tirisfal distrusted him, Arrexis did not. He welcomed Medivh\'s support. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nArrexis\'s trusting nature would be his downfall.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ebonchill, Part Eleven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nNo one knows for sure what Medivh did during his visit with Arrexis. The details are shrouded in mystery and hearsay. Some rumors claim that the Guardian altered Ebonchill so that it would disrupt Arrexis\'s warding spells and destroy the venerated $PLAYER_CLASS$. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nWhatever the truth, it is known that Arrexis heeded Medivh\'s advice. The elderly $PLAYER_CLASS$ and his followers conducted a great ritual to protect an area from demonic incursions. The spell was only meant to be a test, but it had disastrous consequences.\r\n<BR/><BR/>When the magi began their casting, they inadvertently opened a path between Azeroth and the realm of demons, the Twisting Nether. Arrexis and all of his followers were ripped through the gateway and were never seen again. One account states that within the Twisting Nether, a handful of demons fell upon the shocked magi and slaughtered them to the last.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe demons were led by an eredar known as Balaadur. He took Ebonchill as a trophy of his bloody victory, and the ancient tradition of passing the greatstaff from master to apprentice died alongside Arrexis and his doomed protege.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

Apparently, he was some big shot gladiator way back when, and the bosses didn\'t like that because he never stopped winning. So they did what any good businessman would do - they poisoned him before a big fight."',
					'"Even poisoned, the guy wasn\'t a pushover and took out several ogres before he fell. They thought they had taken care of him, but I guess death wasn\'t enough to put him down. Before they knew it, his spirit would show up at matches and kill off all the fighters, ruining a lot of bets in the process.\r\n\r\n"So the ogres called in one of their shaman to sort the spirit out. Turns out the spirit of Gutrek was trapped up in his weapon, which they kept on display at the arena. At the recommendation of the shaman, the ogres took the weapon to some secret place, broke it down into pieces, and scattered the pieces throughout Nagrand."',
					'"Nobody seems to know where the pieces are now, or what someone would need to do to get them back together, but if this thing is as powerful as they say I smell big profts!"',
					'Second Entry:\r\n\r\n"Last night I managed to "borrow" some of the writings from the shaman who helped quell the spirit of Gutrek. I didn\'t have it for long, but I was able to jot down some notes about the location of the pieces of his weapon:\r\n\r\n"The pommel was brought to the Broken Precipice, where it was to be housed in the skull of Gutrek\'s first kill. It looks like it was some manner of large beast that he fought in the big bone pit."',
					'"The hilt was to be buried in the marshlands, among the serpents whose poison claimed Gutrek\'s life. There\'s something there about covering it with a spiral stone, which is supposed to keep the spirit at bay somehow.\r\n\r\n"The final piece, Gutrek\'s blade, was to be displayed in a place of honor for all time overlooking the Ring of Blood. I don\'t think I\'ve seen it there myself, but it says it\'s supposed to be somewhere where it has a clear view of every battle.\r\n\r\n"Still no mention of how it was dismantled or how it can be remade, though..."',
					'Third Entry:\r\n\r\n"I\'m convinced that the secret location where the ogres broke down Gutrek\'s Cleaver is the key to remaking it from the pieces. Otherwise, why wouldn\'t they just break it down like any other weapon? \r\n\r\n"Unfortunately, nobody\'s quite sure where this place is, only that it\'s called the Spirit Forge and that it was overrun by gronn some time ago. Maybe it\'s somewhere in the gorge? There sure are a lot of gronn there"\r\n\r\nThis is the last entry of the journal you were able to recover.',
