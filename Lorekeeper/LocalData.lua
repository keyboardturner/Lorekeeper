					"Jubeka's Journal\r\n\r\nThis document contains the daily journal of one of the master Warlock trainers. The pages are filled with random notes, the occasional drawing of an imp's internal organs and the occasional tidbit on the preferred diet of felhunters.\r\n\r\nNear the end, an entry catches your eye...",
					"Day 26:\r\n\r\nIt has been nearly two weeks since Kanrethad and I arrived in Outland. Almost immediately afterwards, he departed for Shadowmoon Valley. I didn't bother to ask why, as long as he doesn't get himself killed. \r\n\r\nMy research here in this dusty wasteland continues as drudgingly expected. While the Legion's onslaught has subsided, a number of the rarer demon specimens remain.",
					"Day 28:\r\n\r\nThe fel imps of the Path of Anguish in Hellfire are remarkably chatty. I've discovered that they're just as easy to contract into service as their names are to learn. The ritual to summon one is trivial, at best. \r\n\r\nVoidlords are rather difficult to stumble across, but it takes very little persuading to convince one to divulge the name of a rival lord.\r\n\r\nI have wondered once or twice if Kanrethad will ever return, but in the end, it doesn't actually matter. The council can put me to death, so long as my grimoires last, so will my legacy.",
					"Day 32:\r\n\r\nWhile examining the nauseating Ruins of Farahlon today in Netherstorm, I was ambushed by a race of floating eyeball squids. Calling themselves observers, they were unexpectedly intelligent. They expressed a deep desire to bear witness to all forms of magic and willingly offered their services in exchange for the opportunity to consume new forms of magic. \r\n\r\nThe ritual to summon an observer is unexpectedly complex. While natives of the great dark beyond, they are highly migratory and the summoning ritual must compensate for their travels. Without their willing assistance, summoning an observer would be nearly impossible.",
					"Day 35: \r\n\r\nKanrethad returned, looking incredibly grim. Considering his undisciplined technique, it should be no surprise that his research has been less than successful.\r\n\r\nI'm ready to attempt the binding of a higher order member of the Burning Legion, but I dare not attempt the ritual alone. In fact, perhaps Kanrethad would prove the perfect test subject...",
					"Day 36:\r\n\r\nRemarkable! My first attempt to summon a higher order member of the legion failed as spectacularly as planned. The shivarra broke free almost instantly after Kanrethad completed the ritual. \r\n\r\nI expected the frail human to be struck down while I banished the creature. Instead, in the instant that the shivarra's razor-sharp blades sliced through the air, Kanrethad's form shifted and the blades bounced as if striking stone.\r\n\r\nUnlike the typical form of metamorphosis, he did not complete the demonic transformation... perhaps his research has been more successful than I expected.",
					"Day 40:\r\n\r\nThe key to binding a wrathguard was ironically reducing the number of runic symbols used in the summoning circle. Wrathguards are highly resistant to charms and compulsions, but readily respond to basic expressions of strength. \r\n\r\nKanrethad was unexpectedly insightful into the conditioning the Legion uses to compel the wrathguard into action. His ability to express his dominance over lesser demons is remarkable, if short-lived. With great pains, I've been able to inscribe the forms he uses to summon multiple demonic servants at once. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, while he can bind two lesser demons indefinitely, I can only do so for a short time.",
					"Day 47: \r\n\r\nWe left a few ogre corpses in our wake, but studying the ritual circle of Vim'gol revealed additional ways of bolstering our power using demonic sacrifices. While the act greatly enrages our demonic servants, fusing their life energy to our own provides a dramatic increase in power.\r\n\r\nWith a little experimentation, I discovered that the more closely linked you are with the demon you sacrifice, the greater the power of the ritual.\r\n\r\nKanrethad's ability to restrain his demonic transformation seems to have reached a plateau. Once again, his lack of power disgusts me. Things that would be trivial to most Warlocks take him an eternity.",
					"Day 50: \r\n\r\nAt Kanrethad's insistence, we headed for the Altar of Damnation in Shadowmoon Valley. He seems to be convinced that there's more to the Hand of Gul'dan than just a show of power.\r\n\r\nI'm not convinced, but at this point my grimoires are complete. I don't understand his obsession with controlling the flow of demonic power granted by his transformation. \r\n\r\nWhile he plays around with ancient altars, I intend to try my hand at opening a gateway to conjure many wild imps at once...",
					"Day 60:\r\n\r\nKanrethad is up to something. To say that I'm concerned about our next move is a dramatic understatement.",
					"(A ragged note is drawn onto the back cover of the leather journal)\r\n\r\nI'm convinced there is no chance that we will return from this next adventure alive. There's simply no way I can take the risk that my grimoires go unread. For that reason, I've contracted the imps to leave four fragments of my soulstone at the locations listed in my journal.\r\n\r\nI'm sending this journal to you, my trusted friend, that should the need to locate me arise, you bring the four stones together, find my body and ensure that my grimoires are brought back to Azeroth.\r\n\r\nSigned,\r\nJubeka Shadowbreaker"

According to whom? It was these titans who maligned the glory of the Black Empire.",
					"The Pantheon, disturbed by the Old Gods' penchant for evil, waged war upon the elementals and their dark masters.

History, is as always, written by the victor.",
					'The Pantheon shattered the Old Gods\' citadels and chained the five evil gods far beneath the surface of the world. Without the Old Gods\' power to keep their raging spirits bound to the physical world, the elementals were banished to an abyssal plane, where they would contend with one another for all eternity. With the elementals\' departure, nature calmed, and the world settled into a peaceful harmony. The Titans saw that the threat was contained and set to work.\r\n\r\n<A note has been scribbled on the page.>\r\nFools! The power of the elements was not so easily contained. Nor could they bind the influence of the Old Gods. The "peace" the titans offered came only through oppression.',

To help them carve out the fathomless caverns beneath the earth, the Titans created the dwarf-like earthen from magical, living stone. To help them dredge out the seas and lift the land from the sea floor, the Titans created the immense but gentle sea giants. For many ages the Titans moved and shaped the earth, until at last there remained one perfect continent. \r\n\r\n<A note has been scribbled on the page.>\r\nThe author of this tome is either a liar or a fool. Were they truly ignorant of that which lies beyond the waves? Or were they merely commanded to spread titan propaganda?",
					"At the continent's center, the Titans crafted a lake of scintillating energies. The lake, which they named the Well of Eternity, was to be the fount of life for the world. Its potent energies would nurture the bones of the world and empower life to take root in the land's rich soil. Over time, plants, trees, monsters, and creatures of every kind began to thrive on the primordial continent. \r\n\r\n<A note has been scribbled on the page.>\r\nThe titans wounded the world with their recklessness, then insisted it was done by design. Preposterous! It was the Old Gods who nurtured the flesh of this world, not the titans!",

He gazed into the depths of the Great Dark Beyond and embraced that which gazed back. He saw worlds consumed by fel fire, dark creatures of the Twisting Nether overrunning mortal civilizations, the conquest of creation. Now all that remains of him is this skull, which lends the bearer his power to command demons. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nLike most skulls, Thal\'kiel\'s comes with a cautionary tale. Never mind that it\'s been heeded by none.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part One</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nBefore the coming of Sargeras to Argus, the eredar Thal\'kiel ushered in a golden age for his people. Thal\'kiel was a sorcerer of unparalleled talent, and he and his Wakeners pushed the limits of summoning and binding magics, conjuring the arcane entities that helped build the capital\'s wondrous architecture. Thal\'kiel also devised the machines that focused the world\'s latent arcane energy, suffusing Argus with peace, harmony, and vitality. All were in awe of his abilities, including his young apprentice, Archimonde. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThere were rumors that Archimonde coveted Thal\'kiel\'s power and influence, but the eredar leader dismissed these as pure fabrication, for his apprentice had shown him nothing but devotion. Archimonde had even gone to great lengths to commission a custom-made crown for Thal\'kiel, taking the measurements for his head himself.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Two</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThal\'kiel led an order of eredar magi called the Wakeners, specialists in the arts of conjuration and binding. They were renowned for their clever arcane constructs, exploring new frontiers in summoning. Yet Thal\'kiel was never one to rest on his laurels. He thirsted for more. Seeking to elevate his order to levels undreamed of, he searched uncharted terrain, venturing farther than any eredar had dared before. His spells plumbed the vastness of the Great Dark Beyond, petitioning for a deeper well of power.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nOne day, he received an answer.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Three</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThal\'kiel was brilliant, but he was not wise. A dark presence whispered to him, and the eredar\'s mind was consumed with visions of power beyond his wildest imaginings, of ranks upon ranks of deadly servants eager to obey his every whim. These demonic forces made Thal\'kiel\'s arcane constructs look like a child\'s playthings. Afterward, he would despise the arcane, his passion reserved only for fel magic. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThal\'kiel\'s mysterious benefactor bestowed upon him the ability to summon lesser demons, and the eredar immediately spread the knowledge to his Wakeners. Imps and felhounds, infernals and abyssals, all executed the commands of Thal\'kiel and his sorcerers. Convinced that this was the start of a new era, Thal\'kiel feverishly prepared to present his wondrous pets to the rulers of Argus, Velen and Kil\'jaeden.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBrilliant. Not wise.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Four</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nIn the presence of Velen, Kil\'jaeden, and the eredar rulers\' inner circle, the sorcerer Thal\'kiel demonstrated what his fel darlings could do. First, he summoned scores of his familiar arcane constructs and arrayed them in orderly rows. Then the sky went dark, and the clouds roiled as a storm of meteors crashed down. From the craters emerged an army of infernals--which Thal\'kiel unleashed on the constructs. It was a symbolic display of the new era he saw for his people. He watched rapturously as the demons obliterated the unfortunate arcane entities, smashing and burning them until only smoke and embers remained. Such was the demons\' fury that even the nearby columns and statues were reduced to rubble and ash. An acceptable sacrifice on the altar of progress, as far as Thal\'kiel was concerned. \r\n<BR/><BR/>But when he looked upon his colleagues\' faces, he didn\'t see the approval he expected. Kil\'jaeden\'s expression was remote, inscrutable, but there could be no doubt about how Velen felt. He condemned Thal\'kiel\'s new summonings and ordered him never to conjure them again.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Five</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe following is from an account of Thal\'kiel\'s last days, written by an anonymous Wakener. It was recovered from Archimonde\'s private archive.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"After Master Thal\'kiel\'s disastrous demonstration, Velen forbade him from conjuring demons, denouncing his \'new era\' as a failed experiment. Thal\'kiel withdrew to his chambers for weeks. He neither ate nor slept. His only companions were the demonic minions he would summon and then banish in rage, or so we guessed--all we could hear were the shrieks of imps as they were thrust back and forth between this realm and the Twisting Nether. We also sensed the presence of other, larger entities with him, shadowy apparitions of baleful influence, though his servants swore that no one had entered his sanctum.\r\n<BR/><BR/>"When finally Thal\'kiel emerged, he was changed. He had aged by centuries, alone in the dark with his thoughts and his thralls. His back was twisted and stooped, and there was an odd glimmer in his eye. He summoned his Wakeners, and we answered the call, for we loved him like a father.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"He looked at each of us in turn, and said only, \'The new era begins.\'"\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Six</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThal\'kiel commanded his Wakeners to continue their experiments in summoning fel creatures. In secret, he and his sorcerers conjured demons of increasingly dire aspect, and they cast powerful spells to hide their minions in covert training grounds. Shielded from the eyes of Velen and Kil\'jaeden, Thal\'kiel slowly amassed a great demonic army with one purpose: to install him as dictator of Argus.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe Wakeners were united behind Thal\'kiel, save one--his apprentice, Archimonde. Although he had no aversion to demons-in fact, he rather enjoyed them--Archimonde was driven by ambition, and he was eager to prove himself to Velen and Kil\'jaeden. The night before the Wakeners were to stage their coup, Archimonde revealed Thal\'kiel\'s plans to the rulers of the eredar.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"You shall have his head for this," Archimonde said.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Seven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nVelen and Kil\'jaeden were stunned to learn of Thal\'kiel\'s treachery. He had summoned legions of fel beasts to build his personal empire, plotting to assassinate the eredar rulers. He had tapped into a strange new source of power whose limits were unknown, and he needed to be stopped, swiftly and without mercy. To prove his loyalty to Velen and Kil\'jaeden, Archimonde broke the wards that hid where Thal\'kiel\'s demonic army was marshaled, and he led a contingent of magi in storming the secret training grounds.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe battle did not last long. Caught off guard, the Wakeners were easily defeated by the invading magi, and without commanders to direct them, the demons were slaughtered. Archimonde himself confronted his master as he was summoning reinforcements. With a single stroke of his blade, he decapitated Thal\'kiel.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Eight</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nFrom chapter one of A Treatise on Eredar Phrenology:\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"The science of phrenology--the study of skull shape as a means to determine intellectual aptitude--became popular in Argus around the time of the Second Duumvirate. Its proponents believed that an eredar\'s mental faculties, such as willpower, memory, and perception, could be attributed to the shape and size of various protuberances on that individual\'s skull. Some theorized that if an eredar\'s skull was sufficiently well-proportioned for spellcasting, it could be utilized to channel magical energies even after death. This practice was deemed too barbaric to be put into common use, though it was not unheard of. \r\n<BR/><BR/>"Among the most prominent phrenologists during this period were Thal\'kiel and Archimonde. Thal\'kiel in particular was noted for having the archetypal sorcerer\'s skull, for which he was widely admired."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Nine</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAfter they crushed Thal\'kiel\'s rebellion, the eredar rulers\' magi burned the Wakeners\' bodies so their fel taint would not spread, and they destroyed the rebels\' writings to suppress the knowledge of their foul arts. Archimonde oversaw the effort, and when it was done, he was hailed as a hero. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSoon afterward, Archimonde commissioned one of Argus\'s finest jewelers to gild Thal\'kiel\'s skull. He claimed that he was preparing it for viewing--as a grim warning not to follow Thal\'kiel\'s path. In truth, he had it adorned with metals that would enhance its ability to channel magical energy, the perfect decoration for the perfect sorcerer\'s skull, which Archimonde proudly displayed in his domicile.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Ten</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nArchimonde eventually rose to lead the eredar alongside Velen and Kil\'jaeden, and by all accounts, he was a wise and sagacious ruler. In actuality, however, a demonic presence had been slowly infiltrating Archimonde\'s mind, using Thal\'kiel\'s skull as a conduit for its pernicious influence. While Archimonde slept, he saw visions of civilizations consumed in magnificent fel fire, and a dark god standing at the head of a glorious army. The entity whispered promises of strength that were impossible for mere mortals to comprehend, and Archimonde drank them in, eager to learn more of this mysterious being and his invincible legions.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThus when the Dark Titan, Sargeras, finally came to Argus and offered the eredar a place in his kingdom, Archimonde was the first to accept.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Eleven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAfter Archimonde became one of the Burning Legion\'s generals, he put Thal\'kiel\'s skull to good use. In life, Thal\'kiel had been unmatched in his ability to control demonic minions, and his skull was no less adept. World after world fell before Archimonde as he channeled his commands through the skull, compelling multitudes of demons to obey, his forces obliterating opponents with the grace and precision of an expertly choreographed ballet.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSince then, possession of Thal\'kiel\'s skull has passed between a handful of Sargeras\'s elite generals, with preference given to those who lead invasions of the fallen titan\'s most sought-after worlds. The dreadlord Mephistroth, commander of the Legion\'s vanguard in Azeroth, was the last to be seen with it.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

It was forged on the orders of Sargeras after his defeat in the War of the Ancients, intended as a means to conquer Azeroth once and for all. This scepter rips open the fabric of reality, obliterating the barriers between worlds, destroying everything that stands between you and your goal. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIf you\'re lucky, that\'s all the damage it will do.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part One</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nDuring the War of the Ancients, the night elf queen Azshara and her Highborne sorcerers attempted to open a portal that would allow Sargeras into Azeroth. The challenge was unprecedented; never before had anyone built a gateway that was strong enough for a titan. For weeks the Highborne labored without rest, crafting and weaving spells to devise a passage through the night elves\' colossal fount of power, the Well of Eternity. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut just as Sargeras was about to emerge into the world, the night elf resistance disrupted the Highborne\'s spellwork and demolished the Well of Eternity. Sargeras was cast back into the Twisting Nether, his ambition denied, his greatest chance to conquer Azeroth slipping from his grasp. The Dark Titan swore revenge. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nHe would tear down the walls between himself and his prize.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Two</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAfter his defeat at the Well of Eternity, Sargeras immediately planned his next method of infiltrating Azeroth. He knew he couldn\'t rely on a static portal; to serve a titan, such a gateway required an astronomical amount of power, and the most promising source had been destroyed in his last attempt. Moreover, the Highborne\'s laborious preparation and spellwork had given away his intentions, which had allowed the night elf resistance to thwart him. If he wanted to overcome Azeroth\'s defenders, Sargeras needed to enter the world with minimal warning. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Thus he commanded the eredar to forge a tool that would wrench open rifts between worlds for only a short time, just long enough to let a portion of his soul through. Although that meant he couldn\'t enter Azeroth in his most devastating form, such an instrument would clear a path for his avatar to lead the Legion\'s invasion or carry out subtler schemes.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSuch an instrument would also weaken the integrity of the physical universe and threaten to collapse it, but Sargeras considered those to be only side benefits. \r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Three</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nMillennia ago, Sargeras ordered his most talented eredar sorcerers to construct him a cosmic battering ram. They did not disappoint. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nFirst, scores of magi conducted dark rituals to channel countless portals into a single staff. They then projected the empowered artifact into every corner of the Great Dark Beyond, weaving it into the fabric of reality, creating a thread that could be pulled to unravel the seams of the physical universe at will. To fuel this monstrous undertaking, a hundred warlocks sacrificed a hundred demons, selecting them from among the Legion troops that had been part of the failed invasion of Azeroth. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThus was forged the Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras. Thus was born Azeroth\'s doom. \r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Four</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe Scepter of Sargeras is known for the gleaming jewel that adorns its apex. Many theorize that it represents Sargeras\'s baleful eye, which caught only a glimpse of Azeroth before the fallen titan was ripped back to the Twisting Nether. But the truth is far different. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSoon after the War of the Ancients, Sargeras had a vision: the Well of Eternity imploded once again, but this time, it dragged him down to the very core of Azeroth. He was there for only an instant, but in that moment, he saw Azeroth\'s slumbering world-soul--and in that moment, the world-soul opened one eye and gazed at the Dark Titan. He was enraptured. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Since then, the eye of Azeroth\'s world-soul has not been far from his thoughts. He commanded the eredar who forged the scepter to crown it with that lone, wondrous orb. Next to it, the eredar placed two nathrezim wings, a testament to Sargeras\'s conception of the world-soul: corrupted, demonic, and most importantly, his.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Five</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe Scepter of Sargeras was a marvel of arcane and fel sorcery, an instrument fit for a titan. It could lacerate the connective tissue of the physical universe, opening portals to any realm Sargeras desired, yet the rifts it created would allow only a portion of his soul to enter. It was a minor setback. Sargeras would simply have to be more inventive with his plans. And so, he waited.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nMillennia later, Sargeras saw his opportunity. The Guardian Aegwynn had become the most powerful mage on Azeroth, and not even the Council of Tirisfal could control her. Her pride made her a fine candidate for corruption. Sargeras could not infiltrate Azeroth in his most lethal form, but perhaps he could use the rebellious Guardian as a vessel for his machinations.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Six</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nFrom the journal of Aegwynn, Guardian of Tirisfal:\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"We had finished routing the Legion\'s minions when the sky turned black. My mouth went dry, and the hairs on my neck bristled, responding to stimuli that my mortal senses could not comprehend. It was like the coming of a monstrous storm, right before the thunderheads would unleash their cataclysmic onslaught. Yet the air remained as still as great Galakrond\'s bones. Something was wrong, very wrong, and all we could do was wait.\r\n<BR/><BR/>"I\'ll always remember the sound. That slippery, hollow, CRACKING sound, like that of a mace splitting a giant\'s skull. But it was bigger than that-louder, longer. It pierced me like an arrow through my chest, though I knew the breach had happened some distance away. The edges of the world seemed to quiver, and for an instant I thought they might collapse. But they did not. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"That was when the avatar of Sargeras entered the field of battle."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Seven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nIn the icy wastes of Northrend, Sargeras drew the Guardian Aegwynn into battle, advancing on his opponent as the portal he\'d torn into Azeroth closed behind him. His avatar was but a pale shadow of his true form, but that hardly mattered. After all, even if he couldn\'t defeat Aegwynn, he could still use her for his own ends. He had only to weaken her defenses, to create an opening for a shard of his spirit to break through. Just as he\'d infiltrated Azeroth with the scepter, so too would he invade Aegwynn\'s soul, corrupting it into another instrument of the Legion. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Afterward, Aegwynn would remember the battle as the most brutal she\'d ever fought, but she finally destroyed the avatar of Sargeras in an avalanche of arcane might. As she stood triumphant over her fallen foe, she could scarcely believe that she had won. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nLittle did she know that she had lost.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Eight</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nFrom the journal of Aegwynn, Guardian of Tirisfal:\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"I have defeated the avatar of the Great Enemy, Sargeras, but I cannot enjoy my victory. There is a hollowness inside my breast, a persistent ache from a wound whose origin I do not know. It must be from the strain of the battle.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"I will dispose of the remnants of the fallen titan\'s incursion. His avatar, though but a fragment of his full form, rivals Galakrond in stature, and I cannot let his bones take up residence next to the gargantuan proto-dragon\'s. Who knows what foul taint lies in wait to be released? Even in death, the corpse is malevolent, gripping its cursed scepter as if it still intends to rule. \r\n<BR/><BR/>"The scepter. No one must be allowed to wield it. This was the instrument Sargeras used to enter Azeroth, tearing a gash in the universe that threatened to obliterate our world. The eye on top of the staff stares out, mocking me. I shall ensure that it never sees the light of day again."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Nine</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAfter Aegwynn defeated Sargeras\'s avatar, she interred his corpse in the ruins of Suramar, along with the artifacts that he bore. Deep beneath the sea, shielded by enchanted Highborne seals, the Scepter of Sargeras remained for centuries, its power undiminished. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSargeras attempted to regain control of the staff through Aegwynn, but the task proved more difficult than he had estimated. He could sway the Guardian in many ways, but he could not compel her to exhume his scepter from its watery grave. Something held her back, a primal instinct louder than Sargeras\'s whispering. She knew the artifact was dangerous, that its use risked the destruction of all things. Even possessed by the Dark Titan, she would not yield. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Sargeras realized that greater subtlety was needed. Eventually, he extended his pernicious influence to Aegwynn\'s son, Medivh, as he developed in her womb. Through this new vessel, Sargeras planned to recover his beloved scepter. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nHad he succeeded, the world of Draenor might not have been annihilated.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Ten</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nOther than the Dark Titan, the Scepter of Sargeras has had few wielders. One of them was the orc warlock Ner\'zhul.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAfter the Horde\'s defeat in the Second War, Ner\'zhul sought to reinvigorate his followers by opening gateways to new worlds for them to conquer. To that end, he dispatched his servants to recover various artifacts from the Tomb of Sargeras, including the scepter, which the fallen titan had used to infiltrate Azeroth centuries before. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Ner\'zhul was not Sargeras, however, so he could not simply command the staff to open portals. He had to wait until the constellations of Draenor were properly aligned, and he could only use the scepter in conjunction with other artifacts. The warlock grew impatient, frustrated with his limitations. Intoxicated by the Skull of Gul\'dan\'s influence, he had visions of his erstwhile apprentice, who urged him to unleash his godlike powers. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nWhen at last the moment arrived for Ner\'zhul to act, he did so with wild abandon, heedless of the consequences. It mattered not to him if Draenor was destroyed; in fact, he welcomed it as part of his legacy. With the scepter, he blasted hole after hole through the fabric of reality, shredding the seams connecting Draenor to the rest of the physical universe. As he rushed headlong through one of the portals, he could hear the world shattering behind him.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Eleven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAfter Draenor was destroyed, the demon lord Kil\'jaeden wrested control of the Scepter of Sargeras from Ner\'zhul. At last, the artifact was back in the Legion\'s possession, and Kil\'jaeden would set about using it to invade Azeroth. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut he was not as powerful as Sargeras; he could not open a portal mighty enough even for his avatar. Thus he conspired with Kael\'thas Sunstrider to create a gateway through the Sunwell, the blood elves\' ruined fount of power. Combined with the world-rending force of the scepter, Kael\'thas\'s portal cleared the way for Kil\'jaeden\'s full form. \r\n<BR/><BR/>However, before the demon lord could set foot on Azeroth, Anveena, the embodiment of the Sunwell\'s energies, intervened. She sacrificed herself, unleashing all of her strength on the Deceiver and allowing him to be thrown back into the Twisting Nether-along with the Scepter of Sargeras. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe staff has not been seen on Azeroth since. A small comfort, for surely the Legion will use it to infiltrate the world once again. But no matter who wields it, the threat it poses is unspeakable. The destruction of Draenor is testament to the devastation that even mortals can wreak with this weapon.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>'

So our council of six warlocks gathered to discuss how best to investigate the new magics witnessed by these threats.",
					'At first, the six of us refused to cooperate, tossing blame and bickering as easily as shadowbolts and curses. Finally, after several nights, the human Kanrethad spoke out:\n\n"In the wake of the Cataclysm, the rising tensions between the Horde and Alliance have driven the greatest heroes of Azeroth to train for war. Warriors have readied their war banners, the Death Knights of Acherus have learned to control the undead and it is even said the Mages are researching ways to undo time itself."\n\n"The relentless darkness which bathed Azeroth has been pushed back. Cho\'gall is slain and the remnants of the Twilight\'s Hammer cult have been scattered. Ragnaros is defeated and his armies forced back into the Firelands. Deathwing lies torn apart and his Twilight drakes obliterated. However, the powers they commanded are not so easily forgotten... powers untapped and ripe for the taking."',
					'"In fact, among us now stands several who have faced their power firsthand," he said, pointing at a hooded figure across the room. A deep, sinister laugh echoed from the hood as it burst into flames and burned away to reveal the orc enchanter, Ritssyn.\n\n"It is true, pink skin, I was there when the Firelord was vanquished. The intensity of his flame was unlike anything you can imagine." The burning glow of Ritssyn\'s eyes cast eerie shadows over his burn-scarred face and thick-tusked grin.\n\n"Untrue," spat a sharp, feminine voice.  Shinfel, a Blood Elf adorned with sharp spikes of Twilight elementium, glared across the table, "Until you\'ve been a prisoner within your own mind, you know nothing of horror." Shinfel\'s blood had been corrupted during the fight with Cho\'gall and her arms were now covered in black marks left behind by the corruption that had erupted from her skin.  The experience had only served to increase the intensity of her sadism.',
					'Shinfel continued, "Even the Firelord\'s flames were overshadowed by the raw chaos unleashed by the Destroyer."  She paused a moment and glanced to the worgen who remained eerily silent. Zinnin had been present when Deathwing was unmade and had not spoken a word since. Zinnin\'s eyes narrowed for a moment, then snarled at Ritssyn. \r\n\r\nKanrethad stood up from the table and took a deep breath. "This is exactly why we are here. I have no love for any of you, but we each bore witness to pieces of even greater power. Imagine - if we fused the molten fury of the Firelands with the unstoppable chaos of Deathwing. Even the powers of the Burning Legion could not hold a candle to our flames!"',
					'Ritssyn kicked his boots upon the table and snickered, "And just who would do this? You?" he spat. "I think not. You haven\'t been seen in battle since the siege of the Black Temple. If it weren\'t for having shared the secrets of Illidan\'s transformation with this council, I would kill you just for having the audacity of summoning me."\r\n\r\nKanrethad\'s lips pursed for a moment, but he relaxed and continued. "No. The scope of this task exceeds the capabilities of any single member here. I propose this council split into pairs. Ritssyn and Zinnin would lead a group into Sulfuras. Similarly, Shinfel and Zelifrax would hunt down the remaining members of the Twilight\'s Hammer cult and ... persuade them to share what they learned."',
					'The pock-faced gnome applauded with mirthful glee.\n\nKanrethad continued, "Then we return... one year from now and take the results of our expeditions back to our own sects, more powerful than we would have been alone."\n\nRitssyn frowned as he saw the greed drawn out in the human\'s words dance across the council\'s faces.  "And what would keep us from simply killing our partner in their sleep once it was a success?"\n\nKanrethad\'s brow furrowed and he growled, "Which is why we swear that if any member of this council breaks the contract and fails to return or returns alone, the others shall strike them down and banish their soul forever. We either succeed together or die alone."',
					'Ritssyn was a powerful warlock, and could probably defeat Kanrethad by himself. But against all five of us? We all saw his hesitation. We all let our hands drift toward our scrolls and weapons.\n\n"Fine," Ritssyn reluctantly agreed. "I can play along with your fool\'s errand, but first I must know, where will you and that miserable forsaken, Jubeka, be going?"\n\n"Me?" spoke Kanrethad with a wicked grin.
