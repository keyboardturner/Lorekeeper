					"Jubeka's Journal\r\n\r\nThis document contains the daily journal of one of the master Warlock trainers. The pages are filled with random notes, the occasional drawing of an imp's internal organs and the occasional tidbit on the preferred diet of felhunters.\r\n\r\nNear the end, an entry catches your eye...",
					"Day 26:\r\n\r\nIt has been nearly two weeks since Kanrethad and I arrived in Outland. Almost immediately afterwards, he departed for Shadowmoon Valley. I didn't bother to ask why, as long as he doesn't get himself killed. \r\n\r\nMy research here in this dusty wasteland continues as drudgingly expected. While the Legion's onslaught has subsided, a number of the rarer demon specimens remain.",
					"Day 28:\r\n\r\nThe fel imps of the Path of Anguish in Hellfire are remarkably chatty. I've discovered that they're just as easy to contract into service as their names are to learn. The ritual to summon one is trivial, at best. \r\n\r\nVoidlords are rather difficult to stumble across, but it takes very little persuading to convince one to divulge the name of a rival lord.\r\n\r\nI have wondered once or twice if Kanrethad will ever return, but in the end, it doesn't actually matter. The council can put me to death, so long as my grimoires last, so will my legacy.",
					"Day 32:\r\n\r\nWhile examining the nauseating Ruins of Farahlon today in Netherstorm, I was ambushed by a race of floating eyeball squids. Calling themselves observers, they were unexpectedly intelligent. They expressed a deep desire to bear witness to all forms of magic and willingly offered their services in exchange for the opportunity to consume new forms of magic. \r\n\r\nThe ritual to summon an observer is unexpectedly complex. While natives of the great dark beyond, they are highly migratory and the summoning ritual must compensate for their travels. Without their willing assistance, summoning an observer would be nearly impossible.",
					"Day 35: \r\n\r\nKanrethad returned, looking incredibly grim. Considering his undisciplined technique, it should be no surprise that his research has been less than successful.\r\n\r\nI'm ready to attempt the binding of a higher order member of the Burning Legion, but I dare not attempt the ritual alone. In fact, perhaps Kanrethad would prove the perfect test subject...",
					"Day 36:\r\n\r\nRemarkable! My first attempt to summon a higher order member of the legion failed as spectacularly as planned. The shivarra broke free almost instantly after Kanrethad completed the ritual. \r\n\r\nI expected the frail human to be struck down while I banished the creature. Instead, in the instant that the shivarra's razor-sharp blades sliced through the air, Kanrethad's form shifted and the blades bounced as if striking stone.\r\n\r\nUnlike the typical form of metamorphosis, he did not complete the demonic transformation... perhaps his research has been more successful than I expected.",
					"Day 40:\r\n\r\nThe key to binding a wrathguard was ironically reducing the number of runic symbols used in the summoning circle. Wrathguards are highly resistant to charms and compulsions, but readily respond to basic expressions of strength. \r\n\r\nKanrethad was unexpectedly insightful into the conditioning the Legion uses to compel the wrathguard into action. His ability to express his dominance over lesser demons is remarkable, if short-lived. With great pains, I've been able to inscribe the forms he uses to summon multiple demonic servants at once. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, while he can bind two lesser demons indefinitely, I can only do so for a short time.",
					"Day 47: \r\n\r\nWe left a few ogre corpses in our wake, but studying the ritual circle of Vim'gol revealed additional ways of bolstering our power using demonic sacrifices. While the act greatly enrages our demonic servants, fusing their life energy to our own provides a dramatic increase in power.\r\n\r\nWith a little experimentation, I discovered that the more closely linked you are with the demon you sacrifice, the greater the power of the ritual.\r\n\r\nKanrethad's ability to restrain his demonic transformation seems to have reached a plateau. Once again, his lack of power disgusts me. Things that would be trivial to most Warlocks take him an eternity.",
					"Day 50: \r\n\r\nAt Kanrethad's insistence, we headed for the Altar of Damnation in Shadowmoon Valley. He seems to be convinced that there's more to the Hand of Gul'dan than just a show of power.\r\n\r\nI'm not convinced, but at this point my grimoires are complete. I don't understand his obsession with controlling the flow of demonic power granted by his transformation. \r\n\r\nWhile he plays around with ancient altars, I intend to try my hand at opening a gateway to conjure many wild imps at once...",
					"Day 60:\r\n\r\nKanrethad is up to something. To say that I'm concerned about our next move is a dramatic understatement.",
					"(A ragged note is drawn onto the back cover of the leather journal)\r\n\r\nI'm convinced there is no chance that we will return from this next adventure alive. There's simply no way I can take the risk that my grimoires go unread. For that reason, I've contracted the imps to leave four fragments of my soulstone at the locations listed in my journal.\r\n\r\nI'm sending this journal to you, my trusted friend, that should the need to locate me arise, you bring the four stones together, find my body and ensure that my grimoires are brought back to Azeroth.\r\n\r\nSigned,\r\nJubeka Shadowbreaker",

According to whom? It was these titans who maligned the glory of the Black Empire.",

In a fit of jealousy, they tore it asunder.",

Though the elementals were powerful beyond mortal comprehension, their combined forces could not stop the mighty Titans. One by one, the elemental lords fell, and their forces dispersed. \r\n\r\n<A note has been scribbled on the page.>\r\nThe titans do love to make themselves seem grandiose. History, is as always, written by the victor.",

Without the Old Gods\' power to keep their raging spirits bound to the physical world, the elementals were banished to an abyssal plane, where they would contend with one another for all eternity. With the elementals\' departure, nature calmed, and the world settled into a peaceful harmony. The Titans saw that the threat was contained and set to work.\r\n\r\n<A note has been scribbled on the page.>\r\nFools! The power of the elements was not so easily contained. Nor could they bind the influence of the Old Gods. The "peace" the titans offered came only through oppression.',

To help them carve out the fathomless caverns beneath the earth, the Titans created the dwarf-like earthen from magical, living stone. To help them dredge out the seas and lift the land from the sea floor, the Titans created the immense but gentle sea giants. For many ages the Titans moved and shaped the earth, until at last there remained one perfect continent. \r\n\r\n<A note has been scribbled on the page.>\r\nThe author of this tome is either a liar or a fool. Were they truly ignorant of that which lies beyond the waves? Or were they merely commanded to spread titan propaganda?",
					"At the continent's center, the Titans crafted a lake of scintillating energies. The lake, which they named the Well of Eternity, was to be the fount of life for the world. Its potent energies would nurture the bones of the world and empower life to take root in the land's rich soil. Over time, plants, trees, monsters, and creatures of every kind began to thrive on the primordial continent. \r\n\r\n<A note has been scribbled on the page.>\r\nThe titans wounded the world with their recklessness, then insisted it was done by design. Preposterous! It was the Old Gods who nurtured the flesh of this world, not the titans!",

Few among the living know its origins, but its powers are well known to the dead. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nUlthalesh gorges on the souls of its victims, gaining strength with each massacre. During the War of the Ancients, Sargeras gifted one of his favored necrolytes with this infernal blade. At the time, it was known only as Ulthalesh; it wouldn\'t earn its grim epithet until later, after Deadwind Pass was turned into a charnel house, its inhabitants obliterated, the land itself bereft of all life. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSince then, Ulthalesh has grown even more powerful.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,<BR/>Part One</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nBefore his fall from the titan Pantheon, Sargeras defended creation from demons, imprisoning untold numbers of them in Mardum, the Plane of Banishment. Over the millennia, these demons were not idle. The dreadlord Ulthalesh ruled the pocket dimension with an iron fist, plotting for the day when he would exact vengeance. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nWhen Sargeras shattered Mardum to recruit forces for the Burning Legion, he offered his former prisoners an ultimatum: join him or be cast into oblivion. Most of the demons accepted, but scores refused, rallying around Ulthalesh. In answer to the challenge, Sargeras forged a great felsteel scythe from the fires of Mardum\'s destruction, and he used it to harvest the souls of the recalcitrant demons, confining them in a new prison. Ulthalesh, strongest of will, was the last to be devoured.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,<BR/>Part Two</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nSargeras named the scythe Ulthalesh, after the dreadlord who had risen up against him. Ulthalesh\'s spirit gave the weapon unfathomable strength, but with that strength came a curse, for those who bore Ulthalesh were inevitably consumed by it. The scythe would obey its masters\' commands until they were mortally wounded; then Ulthalesh would feast on their souls. Over the centuries, Sargeras bestowed the blade upon cunning nathrezim, ferocious doomlords, and even potent demigods, only to see their spirits devoured by Ulthalesh after they fell. The scythe grew stronger with each master it absorbed, and it became difficult for Sargeras to find servants who could control the weapon. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nOver the wailing of souls trapped within the scythe, the Dark Titan could hear Ulthalesh\'s grim laughter. \r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,<BR/>Part Three</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nDuring the War of the Ancients, the peoples of Azeroth rebelled against the Burning Legion\'s invasion, and Sargeras sought to break their will with Ulthalesh. But first, he had to find a servant who was powerful enough to wield it. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nHis thoughts turned to the eredar Sataiel. She was the first necrolyte with the strength to command the spirits of the living and the dead with fel magic, a feat that rivaled even Kil\'jaeden\'s necromantic abilities. She was also notoriously ambitious, and fearless to the point of arrogance. Ulthalesh\'s baleful reputation did not sway her. When Sargeras gifted her with the weapon, she accepted it eagerly.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"I shall be its final master," Sataiel said. \r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,<BR/>Part Four</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nMillennia ago, Sargeras gave Ulthalesh to Sataiel and commanded her to reap the souls of Azeroth\'s rebellious denizens, starting with the area that would later be known as Deadwind Pass. No one knows what the land was called before the coming of Sataiel. Most would rather not think of it at all. It is the burial site of countless trolls who were methodically slain, their spirits consumed by Ulthalesh, fueling its power to murder more. The scythe would feed and feed until all of the inhabitants were dead. \r\n<BR/><BR/>But Sataiel knew this was just the beginning, a promising start that only hinted at what Ulthalesh was capable of. Sargeras had dispatched her to break the will of Azeroth\'s denizens. It was not enough simply to kill them; bodies could be buried and forgotten. She decided to strike at the very heart of the land so that no new life could take up residence. With Ulthalesh, she would see that Deadwind Pass stood as a monument to the Legion\'s wrath. \r\n\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,<BR/>Part Five</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nUlthalesh has had many masters, but Sataiel was the first to discover the scythe\'s true potential. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAfter she used Ulthalesh to consume the souls of all living creatures in Deadwind Pass, she turned the blade on the land itself, draining it of life. The trees were reduced to withered husks. The marshes became a desiccated waste. The sky turned a sepulchral gray, the sun covered in a burial shroud. Sataiel relished the despair of the scythe\'s new prisoners as they unwittingly assisted in the annihilation of their home. The destruction was absolute. Even Azeroth\'s slumbering world-soul quailed. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSataiel was impressed with her handiwork. So was Ulthalesh.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,<BR/>Part Six</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nFrom the journal of Sataiel, recovered from the ruins of Deadwind Pass:\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"I surveyed the ruination I had wrought with great Ulthalesh, and it was glorious. The land was a mausoleum. Everywhere was blight, decay, destruction-except for one area. The explosive force from our ritual had carved a massive crater into the ground, and it roiled with unnatural energies, forming a magical nexus. I knew in my bones that I had birthed a fount of power more potent than the scythe itself.\r\n<BR/><BR/>"I must inform Sargeras. But something gives me pause, something I cannot dismiss. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"What claim does Sargeras have to this power? Who else but I could have wielded the scythe to the fullness of its potential? No one. Ulthalesh knows this. He urges me not to surrender our progeny. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"With such strength at our command, he says we may one day challenge Sargeras."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,<BR/>Part Seven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nLike all who presume to wield this pernicious blade, Sataiel was ambitious, strong willed, and supremely confident. She had come to Azeroth to prove herself to Sargeras, but when she saw the heights of power she could reach with Ulthalesh, she wondered whether she\'d set her sights too low. She had massacred thousands, turned the land into a tomb, and ripped open a magical nexus of unspeakable force. Her destiny was bright, and she needed no one\'s patronage to achieve it.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nUlthalesh whispered to Sataiel from the scythe, infecting her mind. She decided to keep the magical nexus for herself, and she cast potent wards to hide it from the outside world. Then she cut off all contact with the Legion, biding her time until she and Ulthalesh had the strength to challenge the Dark Titan. \r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,<BR/>Part Eight</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nFor centuries, the necrolyte Sataiel guarded Ulthalesh and hoarded the magical nexus they had created. When Sargeras discovered her deception, he was furious. The fount of power was his by right, and Sataiel was keeping it from him. Not only that, but his spies informed him that she was harboring delusions of grandeur, conspiring with the spirit of Ulthalesh to slay Sargeras. Such arrogance could not go unpunished. The upstart eredar had to be eliminated. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSargeras found his champion in Scavell, the Guardian of Tirisfal. He sent the Guardian visions of a dangerous entity lurking in Deadwind Pass, a demon awaiting the return of the Burning Legion. Scavell boldly took up the charge, hunting down Sataiel and, after an epic battle, slaying her with her own weapon. Her soul was cast screaming into the scythe.\r\n<BR/><BR/>As the Guardian examined the blade, he was filled with dread. Rarely had he seen so mighty an instrument of death, and though he had slain its bearer, he wondered whether the real threat remained unchecked. He decided to hide Ulthalesh where no one would find it.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,<BR/>Part Nine</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nEmpowered by Sataiel\'s spirit, the scythe had grown immeasurably stronger. There seemed to be no limit to how powerful it could become. Sargeras knew of Ulthalesh\'s scheming, of his promises to Sataiel that they could one day rival the Dark Titan. Although he dismissed this as mere bravado, he refused to give Ulthalesh the opportunity to make good on his threat. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Centuries after Scavell hid Ulthalesh, Sargeras twisted the Guardian Medivh\'s mind so he would assist him in regaining control of the scythe. The Guardian became obsessed with this task, and he dispatched the cursed Dark Riders to search for the blade and bring it back to the tower of Karazhan, which had been built on top of the magical nexus in Deadwind Pass--the nexus that Sataiel and Ulthalesh had created. Sargeras was pleased. It was only a matter of time before the Dark Riders would find the weapon, making a mockery of Ulthalesh\'s ambitions.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,<BR/>Part Ten</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nSo powerful was Medivh\'s charge that the Dark Riders continued their quest for Ulthalesh even after the Guardian\'s death. Eventually, their leader, Ariden, was drawn to the scythe when he sensed the keening of the trapped souls within, and he brought it to the catacombs beneath Karazhan. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAriden lacked the willpower and ingenuity of Sataiel, and his stewardship of Ulthalesh did not last long. There are conflicting reports about how he met his end. Some say he succumbed to the scythe\'s curse after he was defeated in battle, but others tell a different story. By all accounts, however, Ulthalesh went missing soon after Ariden\'s death. Its current whereabouts are unknown. Legend holds that only an individual of exceptional skill and fortitude can control it now.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

It has been deemed apocryphal by the Archival Authority of Argus and is currently banned in all Legion-controlled worlds.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"There are few things in creation that Sargeras fears. The Deadwind Harvester, Ulthalesh, is one of them. The necrolyte Sataiel regrets that she did not attempt to slay the fallen titan with it when she had the chance, so she will test whoever dares to wield the weapon in her stead. Ulthalesh does not mind. The scythe\'s master will either overcome Sataiel or be consumed, which will only make the blade more powerful. And then another bearer will take their place. And another.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"Ulthalesh has been playing this game with Sargeras for millennia. He knows the meaning of patience."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

He gazed into the depths of the Great Dark Beyond and embraced that which gazed back. He saw worlds consumed by fel fire, dark creatures of the Twisting Nether overrunning mortal civilizations, the conquest of creation. Now all that remains of him is this skull, which lends the bearer his power to command demons. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nLike most skulls, Thal\'kiel\'s comes with a cautionary tale. Never mind that it\'s been heeded by none.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part One</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nBefore the coming of Sargeras to Argus, the eredar Thal\'kiel ushered in a golden age for his people. Thal\'kiel was a sorcerer of unparalleled talent, and he and his Wakeners pushed the limits of summoning and binding magics, conjuring the arcane entities that helped build the capital\'s wondrous architecture. Thal\'kiel also devised the machines that focused the world\'s latent arcane energy, suffusing Argus with peace, harmony, and vitality. All were in awe of his abilities, including his young apprentice, Archimonde. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThere were rumors that Archimonde coveted Thal\'kiel\'s power and influence, but the eredar leader dismissed these as pure fabrication, for his apprentice had shown him nothing but devotion. Archimonde had even gone to great lengths to commission a custom-made crown for Thal\'kiel, taking the measurements for his head himself.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Two</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThal\'kiel led an order of eredar magi called the Wakeners, specialists in the arts of conjuration and binding. They were renowned for their clever arcane constructs, exploring new frontiers in summoning. Yet Thal\'kiel was never one to rest on his laurels. He thirsted for more. Seeking to elevate his order to levels undreamed of, he searched uncharted terrain, venturing farther than any eredar had dared before. His spells plumbed the vastness of the Great Dark Beyond, petitioning for a deeper well of power.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nOne day, he received an answer.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Three</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThal\'kiel was brilliant, but he was not wise. A dark presence whispered to him, and the eredar\'s mind was consumed with visions of power beyond his wildest imaginings, of ranks upon ranks of deadly servants eager to obey his every whim. These demonic forces made Thal\'kiel\'s arcane constructs look like a child\'s playthings. Afterward, he would despise the arcane, his passion reserved only for fel magic. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThal\'kiel\'s mysterious benefactor bestowed upon him the ability to summon lesser demons, and the eredar immediately spread the knowledge to his Wakeners. Imps and felhounds, infernals and abyssals, all executed the commands of Thal\'kiel and his sorcerers. Convinced that this was the start of a new era, Thal\'kiel feverishly prepared to present his wondrous pets to the rulers of Argus, Velen and Kil\'jaeden.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBrilliant. Not wise.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Four</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nIn the presence of Velen, Kil\'jaeden, and the eredar rulers\' inner circle, the sorcerer Thal\'kiel demonstrated what his fel darlings could do. First, he summoned scores of his familiar arcane constructs and arrayed them in orderly rows. Then the sky went dark, and the clouds roiled as a storm of meteors crashed down. From the craters emerged an army of infernals--which Thal\'kiel unleashed on the constructs. It was a symbolic display of the new era he saw for his people. He watched rapturously as the demons obliterated the unfortunate arcane entities, smashing and burning them until only smoke and embers remained. Such was the demons\' fury that even the nearby columns and statues were reduced to rubble and ash. An acceptable sacrifice on the altar of progress, as far as Thal\'kiel was concerned. \r\n<BR/><BR/>But when he looked upon his colleagues\' faces, he didn\'t see the approval he expected. Kil\'jaeden\'s expression was remote, inscrutable, but there could be no doubt about how Velen felt. He condemned Thal\'kiel\'s new summonings and ordered him never to conjure them again.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Five</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe following is from an account of Thal\'kiel\'s last days, written by an anonymous Wakener. It was recovered from Archimonde\'s private archive.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"After Master Thal\'kiel\'s disastrous demonstration, Velen forbade him from conjuring demons, denouncing his \'new era\' as a failed experiment. Thal\'kiel withdrew to his chambers for weeks. He neither ate nor slept. His only companions were the demonic minions he would summon and then banish in rage, or so we guessed--all we could hear were the shrieks of imps as they were thrust back and forth between this realm and the Twisting Nether. We also sensed the presence of other, larger entities with him, shadowy apparitions of baleful influence, though his servants swore that no one had entered his sanctum.\r\n<BR/><BR/>"When finally Thal\'kiel emerged, he was changed. He had aged by centuries, alone in the dark with his thoughts and his thralls. His back was twisted and stooped, and there was an odd glimmer in his eye. He summoned his Wakeners, and we answered the call, for we loved him like a father.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"He looked at each of us in turn, and said only, \'The new era begins.\'"\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Six</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThal\'kiel commanded his Wakeners to continue their experiments in summoning fel creatures. In secret, he and his sorcerers conjured demons of increasingly dire aspect, and they cast powerful spells to hide their minions in covert training grounds. Shielded from the eyes of Velen and Kil\'jaeden, Thal\'kiel slowly amassed a great demonic army with one purpose: to install him as dictator of Argus.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe Wakeners were united behind Thal\'kiel, save one--his apprentice, Archimonde. Although he had no aversion to demons-in fact, he rather enjoyed them--Archimonde was driven by ambition, and he was eager to prove himself to Velen and Kil\'jaeden. The night before the Wakeners were to stage their coup, Archimonde revealed Thal\'kiel\'s plans to the rulers of the eredar.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"You shall have his head for this," Archimonde said.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Seven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nVelen and Kil\'jaeden were stunned to learn of Thal\'kiel\'s treachery. He had summoned legions of fel beasts to build his personal empire, plotting to assassinate the eredar rulers. He had tapped into a strange new source of power whose limits were unknown, and he needed to be stopped, swiftly and without mercy. To prove his loyalty to Velen and Kil\'jaeden, Archimonde broke the wards that hid where Thal\'kiel\'s demonic army was marshaled, and he led a contingent of magi in storming the secret training grounds.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe battle did not last long. Caught off guard, the Wakeners were easily defeated by the invading magi, and without commanders to direct them, the demons were slaughtered. Archimonde himself confronted his master as he was summoning reinforcements. With a single stroke of his blade, he decapitated Thal\'kiel.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Eight</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nFrom chapter one of A Treatise on Eredar Phrenology:\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"The science of phrenology--the study of skull shape as a means to determine intellectual aptitude--became popular in Argus around the time of the Second Duumvirate. Its proponents believed that an eredar\'s mental faculties, such as willpower, memory, and perception, could be attributed to the shape and size of various protuberances on that individual\'s skull. Some theorized that if an eredar\'s skull was sufficiently well-proportioned for spellcasting, it could be utilized to channel magical energies even after death. This practice was deemed too barbaric to be put into common use, though it was not unheard of. \r\n<BR/><BR/>"Among the most prominent phrenologists during this period were Thal\'kiel and Archimonde. Thal\'kiel in particular was noted for having the archetypal sorcerer\'s skull, for which he was widely admired."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Nine</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAfter they crushed Thal\'kiel\'s rebellion, the eredar rulers\' magi burned the Wakeners\' bodies so their fel taint would not spread, and they destroyed the rebels\' writings to suppress the knowledge of their foul arts. Archimonde oversaw the effort, and when it was done, he was hailed as a hero. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSoon afterward, Archimonde commissioned one of Argus\'s finest jewelers to gild Thal\'kiel\'s skull. He claimed that he was preparing it for viewing--as a grim warning not to follow Thal\'kiel\'s path. In truth, he had it adorned with metals that would enhance its ability to channel magical energy, the perfect decoration for the perfect sorcerer\'s skull, which Archimonde proudly displayed in his domicile.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Ten</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nArchimonde eventually rose to lead the eredar alongside Velen and Kil\'jaeden, and by all accounts, he was a wise and sagacious ruler. In actuality, however, a demonic presence had been slowly infiltrating Archimonde\'s mind, using Thal\'kiel\'s skull as a conduit for its pernicious influence. While Archimonde slept, he saw visions of civilizations consumed in magnificent fel fire, and a dark god standing at the head of a glorious army. The entity whispered promises of strength that were impossible for mere mortals to comprehend, and Archimonde drank them in, eager to learn more of this mysterious being and his invincible legions.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThus when the Dark Titan, Sargeras, finally came to Argus and offered the eredar a place in his kingdom, Archimonde was the first to accept.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Eleven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAfter Archimonde became one of the Burning Legion\'s generals, he put Thal\'kiel\'s skull to good use. In life, Thal\'kiel had been unmatched in his ability to control demonic minions, and his skull was no less adept. World after world fell before Archimonde as he channeled his commands through the skull, compelling multitudes of demons to obey, his forces obliterating opponents with the grace and precision of an expertly choreographed ballet.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSince then, possession of Thal\'kiel\'s skull has passed between a handful of Sargeras\'s elite generals, with preference given to those who lead invasions of the fallen titan\'s most sought-after worlds. The dreadlord Mephistroth, commander of the Legion\'s vanguard in Azeroth, was the last to be seen with it.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

It was forged on the orders of Sargeras after his defeat in the War of the Ancients, intended as a means to conquer Azeroth once and for all. This scepter rips open the fabric of reality, obliterating the barriers between worlds, destroying everything that stands between you and your goal. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIf you\'re lucky, that\'s all the damage it will do.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part One</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nDuring the War of the Ancients, the night elf queen Azshara and her Highborne sorcerers attempted to open a portal that would allow Sargeras into Azeroth. The challenge was unprecedented; never before had anyone built a gateway that was strong enough for a titan. For weeks the Highborne labored without rest, crafting and weaving spells to devise a passage through the night elves\' colossal fount of power, the Well of Eternity. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut just as Sargeras was about to emerge into the world, the night elf resistance disrupted the Highborne\'s spellwork and demolished the Well of Eternity. Sargeras was cast back into the Twisting Nether, his ambition denied, his greatest chance to conquer Azeroth slipping from his grasp. The Dark Titan swore revenge. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nHe would tear down the walls between himself and his prize.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Two</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAfter his defeat at the Well of Eternity, Sargeras immediately planned his next method of infiltrating Azeroth. He knew he couldn\'t rely on a static portal; to serve a titan, such a gateway required an astronomical amount of power, and the most promising source had been destroyed in his last attempt. Moreover, the Highborne\'s laborious preparation and spellwork had given away his intentions, which had allowed the night elf resistance to thwart him. If he wanted to overcome Azeroth\'s defenders, Sargeras needed to enter the world with minimal warning. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Thus he commanded the eredar to forge a tool that would wrench open rifts between worlds for only a short time, just long enough to let a portion of his soul through. Although that meant he couldn\'t enter Azeroth in his most devastating form, such an instrument would clear a path for his avatar to lead the Legion\'s invasion or carry out subtler schemes.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSuch an instrument would also weaken the integrity of the physical universe and threaten to collapse it, but Sargeras considered those to be only side benefits. \r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Three</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nMillennia ago, Sargeras ordered his most talented eredar sorcerers to construct him a cosmic battering ram. They did not disappoint. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nFirst, scores of magi conducted dark rituals to channel countless portals into a single staff. They then projected the empowered artifact into every corner of the Great Dark Beyond, weaving it into the fabric of reality, creating a thread that could be pulled to unravel the seams of the physical universe at will. To fuel this monstrous undertaking, a hundred warlocks sacrificed a hundred demons, selecting them from among the Legion troops that had been part of the failed invasion of Azeroth. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThus was forged the Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras. Thus was born Azeroth\'s doom. \r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Four</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe Scepter of Sargeras is known for the gleaming jewel that adorns its apex. Many theorize that it represents Sargeras\'s baleful eye, which caught only a glimpse of Azeroth before the fallen titan was ripped back to the Twisting Nether. But the truth is far different. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSoon after the War of the Ancients, Sargeras had a vision: the Well of Eternity imploded once again, but this time, it dragged him down to the very core of Azeroth. He was there for only an instant, but in that moment, he saw Azeroth\'s slumbering world-soul--and in that moment, the world-soul opened one eye and gazed at the Dark Titan. He was enraptured. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Since then, the eye of Azeroth\'s world-soul has not been far from his thoughts. He commanded the eredar who forged the scepter to crown it with that lone, wondrous orb. Next to it, the eredar placed two nathrezim wings, a testament to Sargeras\'s conception of the world-soul: corrupted, demonic, and most importantly, his.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Five</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe Scepter of Sargeras was a marvel of arcane and fel sorcery, an instrument fit for a titan. It could lacerate the connective tissue of the physical universe, opening portals to any realm Sargeras desired, yet the rifts it created would allow only a portion of his soul to enter. It was a minor setback. Sargeras would simply have to be more inventive with his plans. And so, he waited.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nMillennia later, Sargeras saw his opportunity. The Guardian Aegwynn had become the most powerful mage on Azeroth, and not even the Council of Tirisfal could control her. Her pride made her a fine candidate for corruption. Sargeras could not infiltrate Azeroth in his most lethal form, but perhaps he could use the rebellious Guardian as a vessel for his machinations.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Six</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nFrom the journal of Aegwynn, Guardian of Tirisfal:\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"We had finished routing the Legion\'s minions when the sky turned black. My mouth went dry, and the hairs on my neck bristled, responding to stimuli that my mortal senses could not comprehend. It was like the coming of a monstrous storm, right before the thunderheads would unleash their cataclysmic onslaught. Yet the air remained as still as great Galakrond\'s bones. Something was wrong, very wrong, and all we could do was wait.\r\n<BR/><BR/>"I\'ll always remember the sound. That slippery, hollow, CRACKING sound, like that of a mace splitting a giant\'s skull. But it was bigger than that-louder, longer. It pierced me like an arrow through my chest, though I knew the breach had happened some distance away. The edges of the world seemed to quiver, and for an instant I thought they might collapse. But they did not. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"That was when the avatar of Sargeras entered the field of battle."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Seven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nIn the icy wastes of Northrend, Sargeras drew the Guardian Aegwynn into battle, advancing on his opponent as the portal he\'d torn into Azeroth closed behind him. His avatar was but a pale shadow of his true form, but that hardly mattered. After all, even if he couldn\'t defeat Aegwynn, he could still use her for his own ends. He had only to weaken her defenses, to create an opening for a shard of his spirit to break through. Just as he\'d infiltrated Azeroth with the scepter, so too would he invade Aegwynn\'s soul, corrupting it into another instrument of the Legion. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Afterward, Aegwynn would remember the battle as the most brutal she\'d ever fought, but she finally destroyed the avatar of Sargeras in an avalanche of arcane might. As she stood triumphant over her fallen foe, she could scarcely believe that she had won. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nLittle did she know that she had lost.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Eight</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nFrom the journal of Aegwynn, Guardian of Tirisfal:\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"I have defeated the avatar of the Great Enemy, Sargeras, but I cannot enjoy my victory. There is a hollowness inside my breast, a persistent ache from a wound whose origin I do not know. It must be from the strain of the battle.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"I will dispose of the remnants of the fallen titan\'s incursion. His avatar, though but a fragment of his full form, rivals Galakrond in stature, and I cannot let his bones take up residence next to the gargantuan proto-dragon\'s. Who knows what foul taint lies in wait to be released? Even in death, the corpse is malevolent, gripping its cursed scepter as if it still intends to rule. \r\n<BR/><BR/>"The scepter. No one must be allowed to wield it. This was the instrument Sargeras used to enter Azeroth, tearing a gash in the universe that threatened to obliterate our world. The eye on top of the staff stares out, mocking me. I shall ensure that it never sees the light of day again."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Nine</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAfter Aegwynn defeated Sargeras\'s avatar, she interred his corpse in the ruins of Suramar, along with the artifacts that he bore. Deep beneath the sea, shielded by enchanted Highborne seals, the Scepter of Sargeras remained for centuries, its power undiminished. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSargeras attempted to regain control of the staff through Aegwynn, but the task proved more difficult than he had estimated. He could sway the Guardian in many ways, but he could not compel her to exhume his scepter from its watery grave. Something held her back, a primal instinct louder than Sargeras\'s whispering. She knew the artifact was dangerous, that its use risked the destruction of all things. Even possessed by the Dark Titan, she would not yield. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Sargeras realized that greater subtlety was needed. Eventually, he extended his pernicious influence to Aegwynn\'s son, Medivh, as he developed in her womb. Through this new vessel, Sargeras planned to recover his beloved scepter. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nHad he succeeded, the world of Draenor might not have been annihilated.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Ten</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nOther than the Dark Titan, the Scepter of Sargeras has had few wielders. One of them was the orc warlock Ner\'zhul.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAfter the Horde\'s defeat in the Second War, Ner\'zhul sought to reinvigorate his followers by opening gateways to new worlds for them to conquer. To that end, he dispatched his servants to recover various artifacts from the Tomb of Sargeras, including the scepter, which the fallen titan had used to infiltrate Azeroth centuries before. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Ner\'zhul was not Sargeras, however, so he could not simply command the staff to open portals. He had to wait until the constellations of Draenor were properly aligned, and he could only use the scepter in conjunction with other artifacts. The warlock grew impatient, frustrated with his limitations. Intoxicated by the Skull of Gul\'dan\'s influence, he had visions of his erstwhile apprentice, who urged him to unleash his godlike powers. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nWhen at last the moment arrived for Ner\'zhul to act, he did so with wild abandon, heedless of the consequences. It mattered not to him if Draenor was destroyed; in fact, he welcomed it as part of his legacy. With the scepter, he blasted hole after hole through the fabric of reality, shredding the seams connecting Draenor to the rest of the physical universe. As he rushed headlong through one of the portals, he could hear the world shattering behind him.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Eleven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAfter Draenor was destroyed, the demon lord Kil\'jaeden wrested control of the Scepter of Sargeras from Ner\'zhul. At last, the artifact was back in the Legion\'s possession, and Kil\'jaeden would set about using it to invade Azeroth. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut he was not as powerful as Sargeras; he could not open a portal mighty enough even for his avatar. Thus he conspired with Kael\'thas Sunstrider to create a gateway through the Sunwell, the blood elves\' ruined fount of power. Combined with the world-rending force of the scepter, Kael\'thas\'s portal cleared the way for Kil\'jaeden\'s full form. \r\n<BR/><BR/>However, before the demon lord could set foot on Azeroth, Anveena, the embodiment of the Sunwell\'s energies, intervened. She sacrificed herself, unleashing all of her strength on the Deceiver and allowing him to be thrown back into the Twisting Nether-along with the Scepter of Sargeras. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe staff has not been seen on Azeroth since. A small comfort, for surely the Legion will use it to infiltrate the world once again. But no matter who wields it, the threat it poses is unspeakable. The destruction of Draenor is testament to the devastation that even mortals can wreak with this weapon.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

He gazed into the depths of the Great Dark Beyond and embraced that which gazed back. He saw worlds consumed by fel fire, dark creatures of the Twisting Nether overrunning mortal civilizations, the conquest of creation. Now all that remains of him is this skull, which lends the bearer his power to command demons. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nLike most skulls, Thal\'kiel\'s comes with a cautionary tale.

Thal\'kiel was a sorcerer of unparalleled talent, and he and his Wakeners pushed the limits of summoning and binding magics, conjuring the arcane entities that helped build the capital\'s wondrous architecture. Thal\'kiel also devised the machines that focused the world\'s latent arcane energy, suffusing Argus with peace, harmony, and vitality. All were in awe of his abilities, including his young apprentice, Archimonde. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThere were rumors that Archimonde coveted Thal\'kiel\'s power and influence, but the eredar leader dismissed these as pure fabrication, for his apprentice had shown him nothing but devotion. Archimonde had even gone to great lengths to commission a custom-made crown for Thal\'kiel, taking the measurements for his head himself.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Two</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThal\'kiel led an order of eredar magi called the Wakeners, specialists in the arts of conjuration and binding. They were renowned for their clever arcane constructs, exploring new frontiers in summoning. Yet Thal\'kiel was never one to rest on his laurels. He thirsted for more. Seeking to elevate his order to levels undreamed of, he searched uncharted terrain, venturing farther than any eredar had dared before. His spells plumbed the vastness of the Great Dark Beyond, petitioning for a deeper well of power.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nOne day, he received an answer.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Three</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThal\'kiel was brilliant, but he was not wise. A dark presence whispered to him, and the eredar\'s mind was consumed with visions of power beyond his wildest imaginings, of ranks upon ranks of deadly servants eager to obey his every whim. These demonic forces made Thal\'kiel\'s arcane constructs look like a child\'s playthings. Afterward, he would despise the arcane, his passion reserved only for fel magic. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThal\'kiel\'s mysterious benefactor bestowed upon him the ability to summon lesser demons, and the eredar immediately spread the knowledge to his Wakeners. Imps and felhounds, infernals and abyssals, all executed the commands of Thal\'kiel and his sorcerers. Convinced that this was the start of a new era, Thal\'kiel feverishly prepared to present his wondrous pets to the rulers of Argus, Velen and Kil\'jaeden.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBrilliant. Not wise.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Four</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nIn the presence of Velen, Kil\'jaeden, and the eredar rulers\' inner circle, the sorcerer Thal\'kiel demonstrated what his fel darlings could do. First, he summoned scores of his familiar arcane constructs and arrayed them in orderly rows. Then the sky went dark, and the clouds roiled as a storm of meteors crashed down. From the craters emerged an army of infernals--which Thal\'kiel unleashed on the constructs. It was a symbolic display of the new era he saw for his people. He watched rapturously as the demons obliterated the unfortunate arcane entities, smashing and burning them until only smoke and embers remained. Such was the demons\' fury that even the nearby columns and statues were reduced to rubble and ash. An acceptable sacrifice on the altar of progress, as far as Thal\'kiel was concerned. \r\n<BR/><BR/>But when he looked upon his colleagues\' faces, he didn\'t see the approval he expected. Kil\'jaeden\'s expression was remote, inscrutable, but there could be no doubt about how Velen felt. He condemned Thal\'kiel\'s new summonings and ordered him never to conjure them again.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Five</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe following is from an account of Thal\'kiel\'s last days, written by an anonymous Wakener. It was recovered from Archimonde\'s private archive.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"After Master Thal\'kiel\'s disastrous demonstration, Velen forbade him from conjuring demons, denouncing his \'new era\' as a failed experiment. Thal\'kiel withdrew to his chambers for weeks. He neither ate nor slept. His only companions were the demonic minions he would summon and then banish in rage, or so we guessed--all we could hear were the shrieks of imps as they were thrust back and forth between this realm and the Twisting Nether. We also sensed the presence of other, larger entities with him, shadowy apparitions of baleful influence, though his servants swore that no one had entered his sanctum.\r\n<BR/><BR/>"When finally Thal\'kiel emerged, he was changed. He had aged by centuries, alone in the dark with his thoughts and his thralls. His back was twisted and stooped, and there was an odd glimmer in his eye. He summoned his Wakeners, and we answered the call, for we loved him like a father.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"He looked at each of us in turn, and said only, \'The new era begins.\'"\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Six</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThal\'kiel commanded his Wakeners to continue their experiments in summoning fel creatures. In secret, he and his sorcerers conjured demons of increasingly dire aspect, and they cast powerful spells to hide their minions in covert training grounds. Shielded from the eyes of Velen and Kil\'jaeden, Thal\'kiel slowly amassed a great demonic army with one purpose: to install him as dictator of Argus.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe Wakeners were united behind Thal\'kiel, save one--his apprentice, Archimonde. Although he had no aversion to demons-in fact, he rather enjoyed them--Archimonde was driven by ambition, and he was eager to prove himself to Velen and Kil\'jaeden. The night before the Wakeners were to stage their coup, Archimonde revealed Thal\'kiel\'s plans to the rulers of the eredar.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"You shall have his head for this," Archimonde said.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Seven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nVelen and Kil\'jaeden were stunned to learn of Thal\'kiel\'s treachery. He had summoned legions of fel beasts to build his personal empire, plotting to assassinate the eredar rulers. He had tapped into a strange new source of power whose limits were unknown, and he needed to be stopped, swiftly and without mercy. To prove his loyalty to Velen and Kil\'jaeden, Archimonde broke the wards that hid where Thal\'kiel\'s demonic army was marshaled, and he led a contingent of magi in storming the secret training grounds.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe battle did not last long. Caught off guard, the Wakeners were easily defeated by the invading magi, and without commanders to direct them, the demons were slaughtered. Archimonde himself confronted his master as he was summoning reinforcements. With a single stroke of his blade, he decapitated Thal\'kiel.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Eight</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nFrom chapter one of A Treatise on Eredar Phrenology:\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"The science of phrenology--the study of skull shape as a means to determine intellectual aptitude--became popular in Argus around the time of the Second Duumvirate. Its proponents believed that an eredar\'s mental faculties, such as willpower, memory, and perception, could be attributed to the shape and size of various protuberances on that individual\'s skull. Some theorized that if an eredar\'s skull was sufficiently well-proportioned for spellcasting, it could be utilized to channel magical energies even after death. This practice was deemed too barbaric to be put into common use, though it was not unheard of. \r\n<BR/><BR/>"Among the most prominent phrenologists during this period were Thal\'kiel and Archimonde. Thal\'kiel in particular was noted for having the archetypal sorcerer\'s skull, for which he was widely admired."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Nine</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAfter they crushed Thal\'kiel\'s rebellion, the eredar rulers\' magi burned the Wakeners\' bodies so their fel taint would not spread, and they destroyed the rebels\' writings to suppress the knowledge of their foul arts. Archimonde oversaw the effort, and when it was done, he was hailed as a hero. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSoon afterward, Archimonde commissioned one of Argus\'s finest jewelers to gild Thal\'kiel\'s skull. He claimed that he was preparing it for viewing--as a grim warning not to follow Thal\'kiel\'s path. In truth, he had it adorned with metals that would enhance its ability to channel magical energy, the perfect decoration for the perfect sorcerer\'s skull, which Archimonde proudly displayed in his domicile.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Ten</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nArchimonde eventually rose to lead the eredar alongside Velen and Kil\'jaeden, and by all accounts, he was a wise and sagacious ruler. In actuality, however, a demonic presence had been slowly infiltrating Archimonde\'s mind, using Thal\'kiel\'s skull as a conduit for its pernicious influence. While Archimonde slept, he saw visions of civilizations consumed in magnificent fel fire, and a dark god standing at the head of a glorious army. The entity whispered promises of strength that were impossible for mere mortals to comprehend, and Archimonde drank them in, eager to learn more of this mysterious being and his invincible legions.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThus when the Dark Titan, Sargeras, finally came to Argus and offered the eredar a place in his kingdom, Archimonde was the first to accept.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Skull of the Man\'ari, Part Eleven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAfter Archimonde became one of the Burning Legion\'s generals, he put Thal\'kiel\'s skull to good use. In life, Thal\'kiel had been unmatched in his ability to control demonic minions, and his skull was no less adept. World after world fell before Archimonde as he channeled his commands through the skull, compelling multitudes of demons to obey, his forces obliterating opponents with the grace and precision of an expertly choreographed ballet.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSince then, possession of Thal\'kiel\'s skull has passed between a handful of Sargeras\'s elite generals, with preference given to those who lead invasions of the fallen titan\'s most sought-after worlds.

Although that meant he couldn\'t enter Azeroth in his most devastating form, such an instrument would clear a path for his avatar to lead the Legion\'s invasion or carry out subtler schemes.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSuch an instrument would also weaken the integrity of the physical universe and threaten to collapse it, but Sargeras considered those to be only side benefits. \r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Three</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nMillennia ago, Sargeras ordered his most talented eredar sorcerers to construct him a cosmic battering ram. They did not disappoint. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nFirst, scores of magi conducted dark rituals to channel countless portals into a single staff. They then projected the empowered artifact into every corner of the Great Dark Beyond, weaving it into the fabric of reality, creating a thread that could be pulled to unravel the seams of the physical universe at will. To fuel this monstrous undertaking, a hundred warlocks sacrificed a hundred demons, selecting them from among the Legion troops that had been part of the failed invasion of Azeroth. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThus was forged the Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras. Thus was born Azeroth\'s doom. \r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Four</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe Scepter of Sargeras is known for the gleaming jewel that adorns its apex. Many theorize that it represents Sargeras\'s baleful eye, which caught only a glimpse of Azeroth before the fallen titan was ripped back to the Twisting Nether. But the truth is far different. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSoon after the War of the Ancients, Sargeras had a vision: the Well of Eternity imploded once again, but this time, it dragged him down to the very core of Azeroth. He was there for only an instant, but in that moment, he saw Azeroth\'s slumbering world-soul--and in that moment, the world-soul opened one eye and gazed at the Dark Titan. He was enraptured. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Since then, the eye of Azeroth\'s world-soul has not been far from his thoughts. He commanded the eredar who forged the scepter to crown it with that lone, wondrous orb. Next to it, the eredar placed two nathrezim wings, a testament to Sargeras\'s conception of the world-soul: corrupted, demonic, and most importantly, his.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Five</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe Scepter of Sargeras was a marvel of arcane and fel sorcery, an instrument fit for a titan. It could lacerate the connective tissue of the physical universe, opening portals to any realm Sargeras desired, yet the rifts it created would allow only a portion of his soul to enter. It was a minor setback. Sargeras would simply have to be more inventive with his plans. And so, he waited.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nMillennia later, Sargeras saw his opportunity. The Guardian Aegwynn had become the most powerful mage on Azeroth, and not even the Council of Tirisfal could control her. Her pride made her a fine candidate for corruption. Sargeras could not infiltrate Azeroth in his most lethal form, but perhaps he could use the rebellious Guardian as a vessel for his machinations.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Six</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nFrom the journal of Aegwynn, Guardian of Tirisfal:\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"We had finished routing the Legion\'s minions when the sky turned black. My mouth went dry, and the hairs on my neck bristled, responding to stimuli that my mortal senses could not comprehend. It was like the coming of a monstrous storm, right before the thunderheads would unleash their cataclysmic onslaught. Yet the air remained as still as great Galakrond\'s bones. Something was wrong, very wrong, and all we could do was wait.\r\n<BR/><BR/>"I\'ll always remember the sound. That slippery, hollow, CRACKING sound, like that of a mace splitting a giant\'s skull. But it was bigger than that-louder, longer. It pierced me like an arrow through my chest, though I knew the breach had happened some distance away. The edges of the world seemed to quiver, and for an instant I thought they might collapse. But they did not. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"That was when the avatar of Sargeras entered the field of battle."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Seven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nIn the icy wastes of Northrend, Sargeras drew the Guardian Aegwynn into battle, advancing on his opponent as the portal he\'d torn into Azeroth closed behind him. His avatar was but a pale shadow of his true form, but that hardly mattered. After all, even if he couldn\'t defeat Aegwynn, he could still use her for his own ends. He had only to weaken her defenses, to create an opening for a shard of his spirit to break through. Just as he\'d infiltrated Azeroth with the scepter, so too would he invade Aegwynn\'s soul, corrupting it into another instrument of the Legion. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Afterward, Aegwynn would remember the battle as the most brutal she\'d ever fought, but she finally destroyed the avatar of Sargeras in an avalanche of arcane might. As she stood triumphant over her fallen foe, she could scarcely believe that she had won. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nLittle did she know that she had lost.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Eight</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nFrom the journal of Aegwynn, Guardian of Tirisfal:\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"I have defeated the avatar of the Great Enemy, Sargeras, but I cannot enjoy my victory. There is a hollowness inside my breast, a persistent ache from a wound whose origin I do not know. It must be from the strain of the battle.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"I will dispose of the remnants of the fallen titan\'s incursion. His avatar, though but a fragment of his full form, rivals Galakrond in stature, and I cannot let his bones take up residence next to the gargantuan proto-dragon\'s. Who knows what foul taint lies in wait to be released? Even in death, the corpse is malevolent, gripping its cursed scepter as if it still intends to rule. \r\n<BR/><BR/>"The scepter. No one must be allowed to wield it. This was the instrument Sargeras used to enter Azeroth, tearing a gash in the universe that threatened to obliterate our world. The eye on top of the staff stares out, mocking me. I shall ensure that it never sees the light of day again."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Nine</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAfter Aegwynn defeated Sargeras\'s avatar, she interred his corpse in the ruins of Suramar, along with the artifacts that he bore. Deep beneath the sea, shielded by enchanted Highborne seals, the Scepter of Sargeras remained for centuries, its power undiminished. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSargeras attempted to regain control of the staff through Aegwynn, but the task proved more difficult than he had estimated. He could sway the Guardian in many ways, but he could not compel her to exhume his scepter from its watery grave. Something held her back, a primal instinct louder than Sargeras\'s whispering. She knew the artifact was dangerous, that its use risked the destruction of all things. Even possessed by the Dark Titan, she would not yield. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Sargeras realized that greater subtlety was needed. Eventually, he extended his pernicious influence to Aegwynn\'s son, Medivh, as he developed in her womb. Through this new vessel, Sargeras planned to recover his beloved scepter. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nHad he succeeded, the world of Draenor might not have been annihilated.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Ten</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nOther than the Dark Titan, the Scepter of Sargeras has had few wielders. One of them was the orc warlock Ner\'zhul.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAfter the Horde\'s defeat in the Second War, Ner\'zhul sought to reinvigorate his followers by opening gateways to new worlds for them to conquer. To that end, he dispatched his servants to recover various artifacts from the Tomb of Sargeras, including the scepter, which the fallen titan had used to infiltrate Azeroth centuries before. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Ner\'zhul was not Sargeras, however, so he could not simply command the staff to open portals. He had to wait until the constellations of Draenor were properly aligned, and he could only use the scepter in conjunction with other artifacts. The warlock grew impatient, frustrated with his limitations. Intoxicated by the Skull of Gul\'dan\'s influence, he had visions of his erstwhile apprentice, who urged him to unleash his godlike powers. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nWhen at last the moment arrived for Ner\'zhul to act, he did so with wild abandon, heedless of the consequences. It mattered not to him if Draenor was destroyed; in fact, he welcomed it as part of his legacy. With the scepter, he blasted hole after hole through the fabric of reality, shredding the seams connecting Draenor to the rest of the physical universe. As he rushed headlong through one of the portals, he could hear the world shattering behind him.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Scepter of Sargeras, Part Eleven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAfter Draenor was destroyed, the demon lord Kil\'jaeden wrested control of the Scepter of Sargeras from Ner\'zhul. At last, the artifact was back in the Legion\'s possession, and Kil\'jaeden would set about using it to invade Azeroth. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut he was not as powerful as Sargeras; he could not open a portal mighty enough even for his avatar. Thus he conspired with Kael\'thas Sunstrider to create a gateway through the Sunwell, the blood elves\' ruined fount of power. Combined with the world-rending force of the scepter, Kael\'thas\'s portal cleared the way for Kil\'jaeden\'s full form. \r\n<BR/><BR/>However, before the demon lord could set foot on Azeroth, Anveena, the embodiment of the Sunwell\'s energies, intervened. She sacrificed herself, unleashing all of her strength on the Deceiver and allowing him to be thrown back into the Twisting Nether-along with the Scepter of Sargeras. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe staff has not been seen on Azeroth since. A small comfort, for surely the Legion will use it to infiltrate the world once again. But no matter who wields it, the threat it poses is unspeakable. The destruction of Draenor is testament to the devastation that even mortals can wreak with this weapon.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

So our council of six warlocks gathered to discuss how best to investigate the new magics witnessed by these threats.",
					'At first, the six of us refused to cooperate, tossing blame and bickering as easily as shadowbolts and curses. Finally, after several nights, the human Kanrethad spoke out:\n\n"In the wake of the Cataclysm, the rising tensions between the Horde and Alliance have driven the greatest heroes of Azeroth to train for war. Warriors have readied their war banners, the Death Knights of Acherus have learned to control the undead and it is even said the Mages are researching ways to undo time itself."\n\n"The relentless darkness which bathed Azeroth has been pushed back. Cho\'gall is slain and the remnants of the Twilight\'s Hammer cult have been scattered. Ragnaros is defeated and his armies forced back into the Firelands. Deathwing lies torn apart and his Twilight drakes obliterated. However, the powers they commanded are not so easily forgotten... powers untapped and ripe for the taking."',
					'"In fact, among us now stands several who have faced their power firsthand," he said, pointing at a hooded figure across the room. A deep, sinister laugh echoed from the hood as it burst into flames and burned away to reveal the orc enchanter, Ritssyn.\n\n"It is true, pink skin, I was there when the Firelord was vanquished. The intensity of his flame was unlike anything you can imagine." The burning glow of Ritssyn\'s eyes cast eerie shadows over his burn-scarred face and thick-tusked grin.\n\n"Untrue," spat a sharp, feminine voice.  Shinfel, a Blood Elf adorned with sharp spikes of Twilight elementium, glared across the table, "Until you\'ve been a prisoner within your own mind, you know nothing of horror." Shinfel\'s blood had been corrupted during the fight with Cho\'gall and her arms were now covered in black marks left behind by the corruption that had erupted from her skin.  The experience had only served to increase the intensity of her sadism.',
					'Shinfel continued, "Even the Firelord\'s flames were overshadowed by the raw chaos unleashed by the Destroyer."  She paused a moment and glanced to the worgen who remained eerily silent. Zinnin had been present when Deathwing was unmade and had not spoken a word since. Zinnin\'s eyes narrowed for a moment, then snarled at Ritssyn. \r\n\r\nKanrethad stood up from the table and took a deep breath. "This is exactly why we are here. I have no love for any of you, but we each bore witness to pieces of even greater power. Imagine - if we fused the molten fury of the Firelands with the unstoppable chaos of Deathwing. Even the powers of the Burning Legion could not hold a candle to our flames!"',
					'Ritssyn kicked his boots upon the table and snickered, "And just who would do this? You?" he spat. "I think not. You haven\'t been seen in battle since the siege of the Black Temple. If it weren\'t for having shared the secrets of Illidan\'s transformation with this council, I would kill you just for having the audacity of summoning me."\r\n\r\nKanrethad\'s lips pursed for a moment, but he relaxed and continued. "No. The scope of this task exceeds the capabilities of any single member here. I propose this council split into pairs. Ritssyn and Zinnin would lead a group into Sulfuras. Similarly, Shinfel and Zelifrax would hunt down the remaining members of the Twilight\'s Hammer cult and ... persuade them to share what they learned."',
					'The pock-faced gnome applauded with mirthful glee.\n\nKanrethad continued, "Then we return... one year from now and take the results of our expeditions back to our own sects, more powerful than we would have been alone."\n\nRitssyn frowned as he saw the greed drawn out in the human\'s words dance across the council\'s faces.  "And what would keep us from simply killing our partner in their sleep once it was a success?"\n\nKanrethad\'s brow furrowed and he growled, "Which is why we swear that if any member of this council breaks the contract and fails to return or returns alone, the others shall strike them down and banish their soul forever. We either succeed together or die alone."',
					'Ritssyn was a powerful warlock, and could probably defeat Kanrethad by himself. But against all five of us? We all saw his hesitation. We all let our hands drift toward our scrolls and weapons.\n\n"Fine," Ritssyn reluctantly agreed. "I can play along with your fool\'s errand, but first I must know, where will you and that miserable forsaken, Jubeka, be going?"\n\n"Me?" spoke Kanrethad with a wicked grin.

The Legion was comprised of a million screaming demons, all ripped from the far corners of the universe, and the demons hungered for conquest. Sargeras' lieutenants, Archimonde the Defiler and Mannoroth the Destructor, prepared their infernal minions to strike. ",
					"Queen Azshara, overwhelmed by the terrible ecstasy of her magic, fell victim to Sargeras' undeniable power and agreed to grant him entrance to her world. Even her Highborne servitors gave themselves over to magic's inevitable corruption and began to worship Sargeras as their god. To show their allegiance to the Legion, the Highborne aided their queen in opening a vast, swirling portal within the depths of the Well of Eternity. ",
					"Once all his preparations had been made, Sargeras began his catastrophic invasion of Azeroth. The warrior-demons of the Burning Legion stormed into the world through the Well of Eternity and laid siege to the night elves' sleeping cities. Led by Archimonde and Mannoroth, the Legion swarmed over the lands of Kalimdor, leaving only ash and sorrow in its wake. ",
					"The demon warlocks called down searing infernals that crashed like hellish meteors into the graceful spires of Kalimdor's temples. A band of burning, bloodletting killers known as the Doomguard marched across Kalimdor's fields, slaughtering everyone in their path. Packs of wild, demonic felhounds ravaged the countryside unopposed. Though the brave Kaldorei warriors rushed to defend their ancient homeland, they were forced to give ground, inch by inch, before the fury of the Legion's onslaught.",

As his impossibly huge shadow drew ever closer to the Well's surface, Azshara gathered the most powerful of her Highborne followers. Only by linking their magics together in one focused spell would they be able to create a gateway large enough for Sargeras to enter.",

The details of the event have been lost to time, but it is known that Neltharion, the Dragon Aspect of the Earth, went mad during a critical engagement against the Burning Legion. He began to split apart as flame and rage erupted from his dark hide. Renaming himself Deathwing, the burning dragon turned on his brethren and drove the five dragonflights from the field of battle.

Wounded and shocked, Alexstrasza and the other noble dragons were forced to abandon their mortal allies. Malfurion and his companions, now hopelessly outnumbered, barely survived the ensuing onslaught. ",

His companions, knowing that the Well was the source of their immortality and powers, were horrified by the rash notion. Yet Tyrande saw the wisdom of Malfurion's theory, so she convinced Cenarius and their comrades to storm Azshara's temple and find a way to shut the Well down for good.",

Dunelle\'s kindness was genuine, a gentle tide that lifted all spirits and ships in the city."',

Tenir\'s Ascent is a saying that has come to mean victory, specifically an armada victory, or one that involves a risky and perilous adventure. \r\n\r\n"My heart was buoyed with joy as I witnessed Tenir\'s ascent into the light streaked sky. I knew my love would return to me, and the emperor\'s armies would prove victorious."',

Popularized from a manual of warfare from the reign of Emperor Laenz IV that described and promoted this tactic. Only after the Air Navy shifted combat to the skies was this tactic abandoned.\r\n \r\n"The spears broke from the weight of the bodies, but the Aegis Wall, like the shield of Thoradin, held."',

"Lightspark" is one of many words found in Arathi speech and literature that are used to indicate a positive or desirable occurrence. A portmanteau of that means something akin to "The beginning of our victory".',
					'Lorel\'s Crossing\r\n\r\nThis is based on an old Arathi fairy tale about a young woman whose town on the frontier fell to raiders. Lorel is a young craftsperson who uses her skills to outwit various dangers as much as she uses her military training. This specific idiom refers to crossing a natural barrier to find a place of safety where one could settle and work.\r\n \r\n"Lorel\'s crossing of the river Aelrea left the wolves snapping not at her heels, but at each other\'s tails."\r\n\r\nLorel has become a popular name among Arathi in the northwest provinces.',

A thin misting fog had begun to coat the rolling green hills of the valley below with dew, and the spire of the Imperial Granary stood out as a dark shadow against the brilliant canvas of stars overhead.\n\nAn evening of good food and many hours smoking the native herbs had put the two friends in a contemplative mood.\n\nZhi - the younger and more tightly wound of the two companions - suddenly asked a very pointed question: "What if none of this is real?"',
					'His old friend Ri, who until now had been leaning back with his hat over his eyes, lifted up the straw brim to peer at his friend. "A serious question?" he said, his brown eyes gleaming intently.\n\nZhi swept his arm over the horizon, indicating the whole of the valley. "What if we are just images, drawn into someone\'s painting?" he asked. He touched the side of his face, gasping. "What if we are characters in a book!?"\n\nOld Ri hugged his belly with both hands and bellowed a deep, contemplative laugh. He took the smoking pipe from his friend Zhi and set it aside.',
					'"Behind the eyes sits a person\'s soul," Old Ri answered at last. "Their essence: the thinking, loving, emotional core of being. My soul makes me real, as does yours."\n\nAnd now Old Ri rose to stand beside his friend. He put his arm around Zhi\'s shoulder and drew his attention to the valley below. "See there below us, to our right? The farmer\'s market?" In the cool autumn darkness, the Halfhill Market was like an island of warm yellow light amongst the dark undulating hills. Colorful flags rippled in the chill breeze, and figures could be seen moving amongst the stalls, buying supplies or bartering the fruits of their labor. The sound of their voices and laughter, indistinguishable from one another but unmistakably alive, could be heard all the way to the inn.',

One orc in particular had always held his interest: the orphaned infant he had found nearly eighteen years before. Blackmoore had raised the young male as a favored slave and named him Thrall. Blackmoore taught the orc about tactics, philosophy, and combat. Thrall was even trained as a gladiator. All the while, the corrupt warden sought to mold the orc into a weapon.",
					"Despite his harsh upbringing, young Thrall grew into a strong, quick-witted orc, and he knew in his heart that a slave's life was not for him. As he grew to maturity, he learned about his people, the orcs, whom he had never met: after their defeat, most of them had been placed in internment camps. Rumor had it that Doomhammer, the orc leader, had escaped from Lordaeron and gone into hiding. Only one rogue clan still operated in secret, trying to evade the watchful eyes of the Alliance.",
					"The resourceful yet inexperienced Thrall decided to escape from Blackmoore's fortress and set off to find others of his kind. During his journeys Thrall visited the internment camps and found his once-mighty race to be strangely cowed and lethargic. Having not found the proud warriors he hoped to discover, Thrall set out to find the last undefeated orc chieftain, Grom Hellscream.",
					"Constantly hunted by the humans, Hellscream nevertheless held onto the Horde's unquenchable will to fight. Aided only by his own devoted Warsong clan, Hellscream continued to wage an underground war against the oppression of his beleaguered people. Unfortunately, Hellscream could never find a way to rouse the captured orcs from their stupor. The impressionable Thrall, inspired by Hellscream's idealism, developed a strong empathy for the Horde and its warrior traditions.",
					"Seeking the truth of his own origins, Thrall traveled north to find the legendary Frostwolf clan. Thrall learned that Gul'dan had exiled the Frostwolves during the early days of the First War. He also discovered that he was the son and heir of the orc hero Durotan, the true chieftain of the Frostwolves who had been murdered in the wilds nearly twenty years before.",
					"Under the tutelage of the venerable shaman Drek'Thar, Thrall studied his people's ancient shamanistic culture, which had been forgotten under Gul'dan's evil rule. Over time, Thrall became a powerful shaman and took his rightful place as chieftain of the exiled Frostwolves. Empowered by the elements themselves and driven to find his destiny, Thrall set off to free the captive clans and heal his race of demonic corruption.",
					"During his travels, Thrall found the aged warchief, Orgrim Doomhammer, who had been living as a hermit for many years. Doomhammer, who had been a close friend of Thrall's father, decided to follow the young, visionary orc and help him free the captive clans. Supported by many of the veteran chieftains, Thrall ultimately succeeded in revitalizing the Horde and giving his people a new spiritual identity.",
					"To symbolize his people's rebirth, Thrall returned to Blackmoore's fortress of Durnholde and put a decisive end to his former master's plans by laying siege to the internment camps. This victory was not without its price: during the liberation of one camp, Doomhammer fell in battle.",
					"Thrall took up Doomhammer's legendary warhammer and donned his black plate-armor to become the new warchief of the Horde. During the following months, Thrall's small but volatile Horde laid waste to the internment camps and stymied the Alliance's best efforts to counter his clever strategies. Encouraged by his best friend and mentor, Grom Hellscream, Thrall worked to ensure that his people would never be slaves again.",

This portal bridged the distance between Azeroth and Draenor, and it was large enough that armies might pass through it.

King Llane, who believed the bestial orcs to be incapable of conquering Azeroth, contemptuously held his position at his capital of Stormwind. However, Sir Lothar became convinced that the battle should be taken directly to the enemy, and he was forced to choose between his convictions and his loyalty to the king. ",

Deciding, at last, to undo their works throughout the universe, he resolved to form an unstoppable army that would set the physical universe aflame.",

Many of the creatures and species that were abundant before the Great Sundering, such as furbolgs and quilboars, reappeared and flourished in the land. Under the druids' benevolent leadership, the night elves enjoyed an era of unprecedented peace and tranquility under the stars.",
					"However, many of the original Highborne survivors grew restless. Like Illidan before them, they fell victim to the withdrawal that came from the loss of their coveted magics. They were tempted to tap the energies of the Well of Eternity and exult in their magical practices. Dath'Remar, the brash, outspoken leader of the Highborne, began to mock the druids publicly, calling them cowards for refusing to wield the magic that he said was theirs by right. ",
					"Malfurion and the druids dismissed Dath'Remar's arguments and warned the Highborne that any use of magic would be punishable by death. In an insolent and ill-fated attempt to convince the druids to rescind their law, Dath'Remar and his followers unleashed a terrible magical storm upon Ashenvale.",
					"The druids could not bring themselves to put so many of their kin to death, so they decided to exile the reckless Highborne from their lands. Dath'Remar and his followers, glad to be rid of their conservative cousins at last, boarded a number of specially crafted ships and set sail upon the seas. Though none of them knew what awaited them beyond the waters of the raging Maelstrom, they were eager to establish their own homeland, where they could practice their coveted magics with impunity. ",
					"The Highborne, or Quel'dorei, as Azshara had named them in ages past, would eventually set shore upon the eastern land men would call Lordaeron. They planned to build their own magical kingdom, Quel'Thalas, and reject the night elves' precepts of moon worship and nocturnal activity. Forever after, they would embrace the sun and be known only as the high elves. ",

That land mass, known as Kalimdor, was home to a number of disparate races and creatures, all vying for survival amongst the savage elements of the waking world. At the dark continent's center was a mysterious lake of incandescent energies.",
					"The lake, which would later be called the Well of Eternity, was the true heart of the world's magic and natural power. Drawing its energies from the infinite Great Dark beyond the world, the Well acted as a mystical fount, sending its potent energies out across the world to nourish life in all its wondrous forms.\r\n\r\nIn time, a primitive tribe of nocturnal humanoids cautiously made their way to the edges of the mesmerizing, enchanted lake.",
					"The feral, nomadic humanoids, drawn by the Well's strange energies, built crude homes upon its tranquil shores. Over time, the Well's cosmic power affected the strange tribe, making them strong, wise and virtually immortal. The tribe adopted the name Kaldorei, which meant -children of the stars- in their native tongue. To celebrate their budding society, they constructed great structures and temples around the lake's periphery.",
					"The Kaldorei, or night elves as they would later be known, worshipped the moon goddess, Elune, and believed that she slept within the Well's shimmering depths during the daylight hours. The early night elf priests and seers studied the Well with an insatiable curiosity, driven to plumb its untold secrets and power. As their society grew, the night elves explored the\r\nbreadth of Kalimdor and encountered its myriad denizens.",
					"The only creatures that gave them pause were the ancient and powerful dragons. Though\r\nthe great serpentine beasts were often reclusive, they did much to safeguard the known lands from potential threats. The night elves believed that the dragons held themselves to be the protectors of the world, and that they and their secrets were best left alone.",
					"In time, the night elves' curiosity led them to meet and befriend a number of powerful entities, not the least of which was Cenarius, a mighty demi-god of the primordial forestlands. The great-hearted Cenarius grew fond of the inquisitive night elves and spent a great deal of time teaching them about the natural world. The tranquil Kaldorei developed a strong empathy for the living forests of Kalimdor and reveled in the harmonious balance of nature.",
					"Yet, as the seemingly endless ages passed, the night elves' civilization expanded both territorially and culturally. Their temples, roads, and dwelling places stretched across the breadth of the dark continent. Azshara, the night elves' beautiful and gifted Queen, built an immense, wondrous palace on the Well's shore that housed her favored servitors within its bejeweled halls. ",
					"Her servitors, whom she called the Quel'dorei or -high-borne,- doted on her every command and believed themselves to be greater than the rest of their lower-caste brethren. Though Queen Azshara was loved equally by all of her people, the high-borne were secretly hated by the jealous masses.\r\n\r\nSharing the priests' curiosity towards the Well of Eternity, Azshara ordered the educated high-borne to plumb its secrets and reveal its true purpose in the world. ",
					"The high-borne buried themselves in their work and studied the Well ceaselessly. In time they developed the ability to manipulate and control the Well's cosmic energies. As their reckless experiments progressed, the high-borne found that they could use their newfound powers to either create or destroy at their leisure. The hapless high-borne had stumbled upon primitive magic and were now resolved to devote themselves to its mastery.",
					"Although they agreed that magic was inherently dangerous if handled irresponsibly, Azshara and her highborne began to practice their spellcraft with reckless abandon. Cenarius and many of the wizened night elf scholars warned that only calamity would result from toying with the clearly volatile arts of magic. But, Azshara and her followers stubbornly continued to expand their burgeoning powers.",
					"As their powers grew, a distinct change came over Azshara and the high-borne. The haughty, aloof upper class became increasingly callous and cruel towards their fellow night elves. A dark, brooding pall veiled Azshara's once entrancing beauty. She began to withdraw from her loving subjects and refused to interact with any but her trusted high-borne priests.",
					"A young, brazen scholar named Furion Stormrage, who had spent much of his time studying the Well's effects, began to suspect that a terrible power was corrupting the high-borne and his beloved Queen. Though he could not conceive the evil that was to come, he knew that the night elves' lives would soon be changed forever....",

Convinced that the Horde would overcome all of humanity if left unchecked, the leaders of the seven human nations met and agreed to unite in what would become known as the Alliance of Lordaeron. ",
					"For the first time in nearly three thousand years, the disparate nations of Arathor were once again united under a common banner. Appointed as Supreme Commander of the Alliance forces, Lord Lothar prepared his armies for the coming of the Horde.",
					"Aided by his lieutenants, Uther the Lightbringer, Admiral Daelin Proudmoore, and Turalyon, Lothar was able to convince Lordaeron's demi-human races of the impending threat as well. The Alliance succeeded in gaining the support of the stoic dwarves of Ironforge and a small number of high elves of Quel'Thalas.",
					"The elves, led at that time by Anasterian Sunstrider, were largely uninterested in the coming conflict. However, they were duty-bound to aid Lothar because he was the last descendent of the Arathi bloodline, which had aided the elves in ages past.",
					"The Horde, now led by Warchief Doomhammer, brought in ogres from its homeworld of Draenor and conscripted the disenfranchised Amani forest trolls into its fold. Setting out on a massive campaign to overrun the dwarf kingdom of Khaz Modan and the southern reaches of Lordaeron, the Horde effortlessly decimated all opposition.",
					"The epic battles of the Second War ranged from large-scale naval skirmishes to massive aerial dogfights. Somehow the Horde had unearthed a powerful artifact known as the Demon Soul and used it to enslave the ancient Dragonqueen, Alexstrasza. Threatening to destroy her precious eggs, the Horde forced Alexstrasza to send her grown children to war. The noble red dragons were forced to fight for the Horde, and fight they did.",
					"The war raged across the continents of Khaz Modan, Lordaeron, and Azeroth itself. As part of its northern campaign, the Horde succeeded in burning down the borderlands of Quel'Thalas, thereby ensuring the elves' final commitment to the Alliance's cause. The greater cities and townships of Lordaeron were razed and devastated by the conflict. Despite the absence of reinforcements and overwhelming odds, Lothar and his allies succeeded in holding their enemies at bay.",
					"However, during the final days of the Second War, as the Horde's victory over the Alliance seemed almost assured, a terrible feud erupted between the two most powerful orcs on Azeroth. As Doomhammer prepared his final assault against the Capital City of Lordaeron - an assault that would have crushed the last remnants of the Alliance - Gul'dan and his followers abandoned their posts and set out to sea.",
					"The bewildered Doomhammer, having lost nearly half of his standing forces to Gul'dan's treachery, was forced to pull back and forsake his greatest chance at victory over the Alliance.",
					"The power-hungry Gul'dan, obsessed with obtaining godhood itself, set out on a desperate search for the undersea Tomb of Sargeras that he believed held the secrets of ultimate power. Having already doomed his fellow orcs to become the slaves of the Burning Legion, Gul'dan thought nothing of his supposed duty to Doomhammer.",
					"Backed by the Stormreaver and Twilight's Hammer clans, Gul'dan succeeded in raising the Tomb of Sargeras from the sea floor. However, when he opened the ancient, flooded vault, he found only crazed demons awaiting him.",
					"Seeking to punish the wayward orcs for their costly betrayal, Doomhammer sent his forces to kill Gul'dan and bring the renegades back into the fold. For his recklessness, Gul'dan was torn apart by the maddened demons he had set loose. With their leader dead, the renegade clans quickly fell before Doomhammer's enraged legions.",
					"Though the rebellion had been quelled, the Horde was unable to recoup the terrible losses it had suffered. Gul'dan's betrayal had afforded the Alliance not only hope, but also time to regroup and retaliate.",
					"Lord Lothar, seeing that the Horde was fracturing from within, gathered the last of his forces and pushed Doomhammer south, back into the shattered heartland of Stormwind. There, the Alliance forces trapped the retreating Horde within the volcanic fortress of Blackrock Spire. Though Lord Lothar fell in battle at the Spire's base, his lieutenant, Turalyon, rallied the Alliance forces at the eleventh hour and drove the Horde back into the abysmal Swamp of Sorrows. ",
					"Turalyon's forces succeeded in destroying the Dark Portal, the mystical gateway that connected the orcs to their homeworld of Draenor. Cut off from its reinforcements and fractured by infighting, the Horde finally buckled in upon itself and fell before the might of the Alliance.",
					"The scattered orc clans were quickly rounded up and placed within guarded internment camps. Though it seemed that the Horde had been defeated for good, some remained highly skeptical that peace would last. Khadgar, now an Archmage of some renown, convinced the Alliance high command to build the fortress of Nethergarde that would watch over the ruins of the Dark Portal and ensure that there would be no further invasions from Draenor.",

After many peaceful years of growth and commerce, mighty Thoradin departed on one final quest, never to return, leaving Arathor's younger generation free to expand the empire beyond the lands of Strom.",

These magi, initially chosen for their strong wills and noble spirits, had always practiced their magic with care and responsibility; however, they passed their secrets and powers onto a newer generation that had no concept of the rigors of war or the necessity for self-restraint. ",
					"These younger magicians began to practice magic for personal gain rather than out of any responsibility towards their fellows. ",
					"As the empire grew and expanded into new lands, the young magicians also spread out into the southlands. Wielding their mystical powers, the magicians protected their brethren from the wild creatures of the land and made it possible for new city-states to be constructed in the wilderness. Yet, as their powers grew, the magicians became ever more conceited and isolated from the rest of society.",
					"The second Arathorian city-state of Dalaran was founded in the lands north of Strom. Many fledgling wizards left the restraining confines of Strom behind and traveled to Dalaran, where they hoped to use their new powers with greater freedom. These magicians used their skills to build up the enchanted spires of Dalaran and reveled in the pursuit of their studies. ",
					"The citizens of Dalaran tolerated the magicians' endeavors and built up a bustling economy under the protection of their magic-using defenders. Yet, as more and more magicians practiced their arts, the fabric of reality around Dalaran began to weaken and tear.",
					"The sinister agents of the Burning Legion, who had been banished when the Well of Eternity collapsed, were lured back into the world by the heedless spellcasting of the magicians of Dalaran. Though these relatively weak demons did not appear in force, they did sew considerable confusion and chaos within the streets of Dalaran. ",
					"Most of these demonic encounters were isolated events, and the ruling Magocrats did what they could to keep such events hidden from the public. The most powerful magicians were sent to capture the elusive demons, but they often found themselves hopelessly outmatched by the lone agents of the mighty Legion.",
					"After a few months the superstitious peasantry began to suspect that their sorcerous rulers were hiding something terrible from them. Rumors of revolution began to sweep through the streets of Dalaran as the paranoid citizenry questioned the motives and practices of the magicians they had once admired. The Magocrats, fearing that the peasants would revolt and that Strom would take action against them, turned to the only group they felt would understand their particular problem: the elves.",
					"Upon hearing the Magocrats' news of demonic activity in Dalaran, the elves quickly dispatched their mightiest wizards to the human lands. The elven wizards studied the energy currents in Dalaran and made detailed reports of all demonic activity that they beheld. They concluded that although there were only a few demons loose in the world, the Legion itself would remain a dire threat so long as humans continued to wield the forces of magic. ",
					"The Council of Silvermoon, which ruled over the elves of Quel'Thalas, entered into a secret pact with the Magocrat lords of Dalaran. The elves told the Magocrats about the history of ancient Kalimdor and of the Burning Legion, a history which still threatened the world. They informed the humans that so long as they used magic, they would need to protect their citizenry from the malicious agents of the Legion. ",
					"The Magocrats proposed the notion of empowering a single mortal champion who would utilize their powers in order to fight a never-ending secret war against the Legion. It was stressed that the majority of mankind could never know about the Guardians or the threat of the Legion for fear that they would riot in fear and paranoia. The elves agreed to the proposal and founded a secret society that would watch over the selection of the Guardian and help to stem the rise of chaos in the world.",
					"The society held its secret meetings in the shadowed Tirisfal Glades, where the high elves had first settled in Lordaeron. Thus, they named the secret sect the Guardians of Tirisfal. The mortal champions who were chosen to be Guardians were imbued with incredible powers of both elven and human magic. Though there would only ever be one Guardian at a time, they held such vast power that they could single-handedly fight back the Legion's agents wherever they were found in the world. ",
					"The Guardian power was so great that only the Council of Tirisfal was allowed to choose potential successors to the mantle of Guardianship. Whenever a Guardian grew too old, or wearied of the secret war against chaos, the Council chose a new champion, and under controlled conditions, formally channeled the Guardian power into its new agent.",
					"As the generations passed, Guardians defended the masses of humanity from the invisible threat of the Burning Legion throughout the lands of Arathor and Quel'Thalas.

One of the last Guardians of the age distinguished herself as a mighty warrior against the shadow. ",

					"She believed that the ancient elves and the elderly men who presided over the council were too rigid in their thinking and not farsighted enough to put a decisive end to the conflict against chaos. Impatient with lengthy discussion and debate, she yearned to prove herself worthy to her peers and superiors, and as a result frequently chose valor over wisdom in crucial situations.",
					"As her mastery over the cosmic power of Tirisfal grew, Aegwynn became aware of a number of powerful demons that stalked the icy northern continent of Northrend. Traveling to the distant north, Aegwynn tracked the demons into the mountains. There, she found that the demons were hunting one of the last surviving dragonflights and draining the ancient creatures of their innate magic. ",

Aegwynn confronted the demons, and with help from the noble dragons, eradicated them. Yet, as the last demon was banished from the mortal world, a great storm erupted throughout the north.",

He informed the young Guardian that the time of Tirisfal was about to come to an end and that the world would soon bow before the onslaught of the Legion. ",

With disconcerting ease, Aegwynn battered the demonlord with her powers and succeeded in killing his physical shell. Fearing that Sargeras' spirit would linger on, Aegwynn locked the ruined husk of his body within one of the ancient halls of Kalimdor that had been blasted to the bottom of the sea when the Well of Eternity collapsed.

The lord of the Legion was preparing to pass through the Well of Eternity and enter the ravaged world. As his impossibly huge shadow drew ever closer to the Well's surface, Azshara gathered the most powerful of her Highborne followers. Only by linking their magics together in one focused spell would they be able to create a gateway large enough for Sargeras to enter.",
					"As the battle raged across the burning fields of Kalimdor, a terrible turn of events unfolded. The details of the event have been lost to time, but it is known that Neltharion, the Dragon Aspect of the Earth, went mad during a critical engagement against the Burning Legion. He began to split apart as flame and rage erupted from his dark hide. Renaming himself Deathwing, the burning dragon turned on his brethren and drove the five dragonflights from the field of battle. ",
					"Deathwing's sudden betrayal was so destructive that the five dragonflights never truly recovered. Wounded and shocked, Alexstrasza and the other noble dragons were forced to abandon their mortal allies. Malfurion and his companions, now hopelessly outnumbered, barely survived the ensuing onslaught. ",
					"Malfurion, convinced that the Well of Eternity was the demons' umbilical link to the physical world, insisted that it should be destroyed. His companions, knowing that the Well was the source of their immortality and powers, were horrified by the rash notion. Yet Tyrande saw the wisdom of Malfurion's theory, so she convinced Cenarius and their comrades to storm Azshara's temple and find a way to shut the Well down for good.",

					"For the first time in nearly three thousand years, the disparate nations of Arathor were once again united under a common banner. Appointed as Supreme Commander of the Alliance forces, Lord Lothar prepared his armies for the coming of the Horde.",

The Alliance succeeded in gaining the support of the stoic dwarves of Ironforge and a small number of high elves of Quel'Thalas.",
					"The elves, led at that time by Anasterian Sunstrider, were largely uninterested in the coming conflict. However, they were duty-bound to aid Lothar because he was the last descendent of the Arathi bloodline, which had aided the elves in ages past.",

Setting out on a massive campaign to overrun the dwarf kingdom of Khaz Modan and the southern reaches of Lordaeron, the Horde effortlessly decimated all opposition.",
					"The epic battles of the Second War ranged from large-scale naval skirmishes to massive aerial dogfights. Somehow the Horde had unearthed a powerful artifact known as the Demon Soul and used it to enslave the ancient Dragonqueen, Alexstrasza. Threatening to destroy her precious eggs, the Horde forced Alexstrasza to send her grown children to war. The noble red dragons were forced to fight for the Horde, and fight they did.",
					"The war raged across the continents of Khaz Modan, Lordaeron, and Azeroth itself. As part of its northern campaign, the Horde succeeded in burning down the borderlands of Quel'Thalas, thereby ensuring the elves' final commitment to the Alliance's cause. The greater cities and townships of Lordaeron were razed and devastated by the conflict. Despite the absence of reinforcements and overwhelming odds, Lothar and his allies succeeded in holding their enemies at bay.",

As Doomhammer prepared his final assault against the Capital City of Lordaeron - an assault that would have crushed the last remnants of the Alliance - Gul'dan and his followers abandoned their posts and set out to sea.",

Having already doomed his fellow orcs to become the slaves of the Burning Legion, Gul'dan thought nothing of his supposed duty to Doomhammer.",
					"Backed by the Stormreaver and Twilight's Hammer clans, Gul'dan succeeded in raising the Tomb of Sargeras from the sea floor. However, when he opened the ancient, flooded vault, he found only crazed demons awaiting him.",
					"Seeking to punish the wayward orcs for their costly betrayal, Doomhammer sent his forces to kill Gul'dan and bring the renegades back into the fold. For his recklessness, Gul'dan was torn apart by the maddened demons he had set loose. With their leader dead, the renegade clans quickly fell before Doomhammer's enraged legions.",

There, the Alliance forces trapped the retreating Horde within the volcanic fortress of Blackrock Spire. Though Lord Lothar fell in battle at the Spire's base, his lieutenant, Turalyon, rallied the Alliance forces at the eleventh hour and drove the Horde back into the abysmal Swamp of Sorrows. ",

Though it seemed that the Horde had been defeated for good, some remained highly skeptical that peace would last.

Most notable of them was the archmage of Dalaran, Kel'Thuzad, who was one of senior members of the Kirin Tor, Dalaran's ruling council. He had been considered a maverick for years due to his insistence on studying the forbidden arts of necromancy. ",
					"Driven to learn all he could of the magical world and its shadowy wonders, he was frustrated by what he saw as his peers' outmoded and unimaginative precepts. Upon hearing the powerful summons from Northrend, the archmage bent all of his considerable will to communing with the mysterious voice. Convinced that the Kirin Tor was too squeamish to seize the power and knowledge inherent in the dark arts, he resigned himself to learn what he could from the immensely powerful Lich King.",
					"Leaving behind his fortune and prestigious political standing, Kel'Thuzad abandoned the ways of the Kirin Tor and left Dalaran forever. Prodded by the Lich King's persistent voice in his mind, he sold his vast holdings and stored away his fortunes. Traveling alone over many leagues of both land and sea, he finally reached the frozen shores of Northrend.",
					"Intent on reaching Icecrown and offering his services to the Lich King, the archmage passed through the ravaged, war-torn ruins of Azjol-Nerub. Kel'Thuzad saw firsthand the scope and ferocity of Ner'zhul's power. He began to realize that allying himself with the mysterious Lich King might be both wise and potentially fruitful.",
					"After long months of trekking through the harsh arctic wastelands, Kel'Thuzad finally reached the dark glacier of Icecrown. He boldly approached Ner'zhul's dark citadel and was shocked when the undead guardsmen silently let him pass as though he was expected. ",
					"Kel'Thuzad descended deep into the cold earth and found his way down to the bottom of the glacier. There, in the endless cavern of ice and shadows, he prostrated himself before the Frozen Throne and offered his soul to the dark lord of the dead.",
					"The Lich King was pleased with his latest conscript. He promised Kel'Thuzad immortality and great power in exchange for his loyalty and obedience. Eager for dark knowledge and power, Kel'Thuzad accepted his first great mission: to go into the world of men and found a new religion that would worship the Lich King as a god.",
					"To help the archmage accomplish his mission, Ner'zhul left Kel'Thuzad's humanity intact. The aged yet still charismatic wizard was charged with using his powers of illusion and persuasion to lull the downtrodden, disenfranchised masses of Lordaeron into a state of trust and belief. Then, once he had their attention, he would offer them a new vision of what society could be - and a new figurehead to call their king.",
					"Kel'Thuzad returned to Lordaeron in disguise, and over the span of three years, he used his fortune and intellect to gather a clandestine brotherhood of like-minded men and women. The brotherhood, which he called the Cult of the Damned, promised its acolytes social equality and eternal life on Azeroth in exchange for their service and obedience to Ner'zhul. ",
					"As the months passed, Kel'Thuzad found many eager volunteers for his new cult amongst the tired, overburdened laborers of Lordaeron. It was surprisingly easy for Kel'Thuzad to achieve his goal: namely, to transfer the citizens' faith in the Holy Light into belief in Ner'zhul's dark shadow. As the Cult of the Damned grew in size and influence, Kel'Thuzad made sure to hide its workings from the authorities of Lordaeron.",
					"With Kel'Thuzad's success in Lordaeron, the Lich King made the final preparations for his assault against human civilization. Placing his plague-energies into a number of portable artifacts called plague-cauldrons, Ner'zhul ordered Kel'Thuzad to transport the cauldrons to Lordaeron, where they would be hidden within various cult-controlled villages. ",
					"The cauldrons, protected by the loyal cultists, would then act as plague-generators, sending the plague seeping out across the unsuspecting farmlands and cities of northern Lordaeron.",
					"The Lich King's plan worked perfectly. Many of Lordaeron's northern villages were contaminated almost immediately. Just as in Northrend, the citizens who contracted the plague died and arose as the Lich King's willing slaves. ",
					"The cultists under Kel'Thuzad were eager to die and be raised again in their dark lord's service. They exulted in the prospect of immortality through undeath. As the plague spread, more and more feral zombies arose in the northlands. Kel'Thuzad looked upon the Lich King's growing army and named it the Scourge, for soon it would march upon the gates of Lordaeron and scour humanity from the face of the world. ",

The warriors are deployed to the front lines from Captain Galvangar's fortress: Iceblood Garrison. The most efficient manner in which to take out this layer of the defenses is to destroy Iceblood Garrison.\r\n\r\nLay siege to the fortress and destroy Captain Galvangar. Once this is done, the front lines will crumble.\r\n",

Destroying the Frostwolf towers that sit near the front lines will cripple the Legionnaire and patrols that swarm the rear flank.\r\n\r\nThe towers are heavily fortified, each housing one of Drek'Thar's elite Commanders. They must be killed. This will expedite the dismantling of the Frostwolf defenses.",

Their resolve is already weakening.

Ripe for the picking!\r\n",

King Llane, who believed the bestial orcs to be incapable of conquering Azeroth, contemptuously held his position at his capital of Stormwind. However, Sir Lothar became convinced that the battle should be taken directly to the enemy, and he was forced to choose between his convictions and his loyalty to the king. ",

King Bronzebeard offered the Wildhammers a place to live within the borders of Ironforge, but the Wildhammers steadfastly refused. Khardros took his people north towards the lands of Lordaeron.

Bolstered by mutual trade, the two kingdoms prospered. After the deaths of Madoran and Khardros, their sons jointly commissioned two great statues in honor of their fathers. ",

They took to living above ground on the slopes of Aerie Peak, instead of carving a vast kingdom within the mountain.

However, the Council of Tirisfal finally decreed that her stewardship had come to an end. ",
					"The Council ordered Aegwynn to return to Dalaran so that they could choose a new successor for the Guardian power. Yet Aegwynn, ever distrustful of the Council, decided to choose a successor on her own.",
					"The proud Aegwynn planned to give birth to a son whom she would divest her power to. She had no intention of allowing the Order of Tirisfal to manipulate her successor as they had tried to manipulate her. Traveling to the southern nation of Azeroth, Aegwynn found the perfect man to father her son: a skilled human magician known as Nielas Aran. ",
					"Aran was the court conjuror and advisor for Azeroth's king. Aegwynn seduced the magician and conceived a son by him. Nielas' natural affinity for magic would run deep within the unborn child and define the tragic steps the child would later take. The power of Tirisfal was also implanted in the child, yet it wasn't to awaken until he reached physical maturity.",
					'Time passed, and Aegwynn gave birth to her son in a secluded grove. Naming the boy Medivh, which means "keeper of secrets" in the high elven tongue, Aegwynn believed that the boy would mature to become the next Guardian. Unfortunately the malignant spirit of Sargeras, which had been hiding inside her, had possessed the defenseless child while it was still in her womb. Aegwynn had no idea that the world\'s newest Guardian was already possessed by its greatest nemesis.',
					"Certain that her baby was healthy and sound, Aegwynn delivered young Medivh to the court of Azeroth and left him there to be raised by his mortal father and his people. She then wandered into the wilderness and prepared to pass into whatever afterlife awaited her. Medivh grew to become a strong boy and had no idea of the potential power of his Tirisfalin birthright.",
					"Sargeras bided his time until the youth's power manifested itself. By the time Medivh had reached his teenage years, he had become very popular in Azeroth for his magical prowess and often went off on adventures with his two friends: Llane, the prince of Azeroth, and Anduin Lothar, one of the last descendents of the Arathi bloodline. The three boys constantly caused mischief around the kingdom, but they were well liked by the general citizenry.",
					"When Medivh reached the age of fourteen, the cosmic power inside him awakened and clashed with the pervasive spirit of Sargeras that lurked within his soul. Medivh fell into a catatonic state which lasted for many years. \r\n",
					"When he awakened from his coma, he found that he had grown to adulthood, and his friends Llane and Anduin had become the regents of Azeroth. Though he wished to use his incredible newfound powers to protect the land he called home, the dark spirit of Sargeras twisted his thoughts and emotions towards an insidious end. ",
					"Sargeras reveled within the darkening heart of Medivh, for he knew that his plans for the second invasion of the world were nearing completion, and that the world's last Guardian would bring them all to fruition. ",

Without the Old Gods' power to keep their raging spirits bound to the physical world, the elementals were banished to an abyssal plane, where they would contend with one another for all eternity. With the elementals' departure, nature calmed, and the world settled into a peaceful harmony. The Titans saw that the threat was contained and set to work.",

To help them carve out the fathomless caverns beneath the earth, the Titans created the dwarf-like earthen from magical, living stone. To help them dredge out the seas and lift the land from the sea floor, the Titans created the immense but gentle sea giants. For many ages the Titans moved and shaped the earth, until at last there remained one perfect continent. ",

Its potent energies would nurture the bones of the world and empower life to take root in the land's rich soil. Over time, plants, trees, monsters, and creatures of every kind began to thrive on the primordial continent. ",

There were twin troll empires -- the Gurubashi Empire of the southeastern jungles -- and the Amani Empire of the middle forestlands.",
					"There were smaller tribes that lived far to the north (in the region now known as Northrend). These tribes founded a small nation known as Gundrak, but never achieved the size or prosperity of the southern empires.",
					"The Gurubashi and Amani empires had little love for one another, but rarely warred against each other. At the time, their greatest common enemy was a third empire -- the civilization of Azj'Aqir. The aqir were intelligent insectoids who ruled the lands of the far west. These clever insectoids were greatly expansionistic and incredibly evil. The aqir were obsessed with eradicating all non-insect life from the fields of Kalimdor. ",
					"The trolls fought them for many thousands of years, but never succeeded in winning a true victory over the aqir. Eventually, due to the troll's persistence, the aqiri kingdom split in half as its citizens fled to separate colonies in the far northern and southern regions of the continent. ",
					"Two aqiri city-states emerged -- Azjol-Nerub in the northern wastes, and Ahn'Qiraj in the southern desert. Though the trolls suspected that there were other aqiri colonies beneath Kalimdor, their existence was never verified.",
					"With the insectoids driven into exile, the twin troll empires returned to business as usual. Despite their great victory, neither civilization expanded much farther than their original boundaries. However, ancient texts speak of a small faction of trolls that broke off from the Amani Empire and founded their own colony in the heart of the dark continent. ",
					"There, these brave pioneers discovered the cosmic Well of Eternity which transformed them into beings of immense power. Some legends suggest that these adventurous trolls were the first night elves, though this theory has never been proven.",

Most notable of them was the archmage of Dalaran, Kel'Thuzad, who was one of senior members of the Kirin Tor, Dalaran's ruling council. He had been considered a maverick for years due to his insistence on studying the forbidden arts of necromancy. ",
					"Driven to learn all he could of the magical world and its shadowy wonders, he was frustrated by what he saw as his peers' outmoded and unimaginative precepts. Upon hearing the powerful summons from Northrend, the archmage bent all of his considerable will to communing with the mysterious voice. Convinced that the Kirin Tor was too squeamish to seize the power and knowledge inherent in the dark arts, he resigned himself to learn what he could from the immensely powerful Lich King.",
					"Leaving behind his fortune and prestigious political standing, Kel'Thuzad abandoned the ways of the Kirin Tor and left Dalaran forever. Prodded by the Lich King's persistent voice in his mind, he sold his vast holdings and stored away his fortunes. Traveling alone over many leagues of both land and sea, he finally reached the frozen shores of Northrend.",
					"Intent on reaching Icecrown and offering his services to the Lich King, the archmage passed through the ravaged, war-torn ruins of Azjol-Nerub. Kel'Thuzad saw firsthand the scope and ferocity of Ner'zhul's power. He began to realize that allying himself with the mysterious Lich King might be both wise and potentially fruitful.",
					"After long months of trekking through the harsh arctic wastelands, Kel'Thuzad finally reached the dark glacier of Icecrown. He boldly approached Ner'zhul's dark citadel and was shocked when the undead guardsmen silently let him pass as though he was expected. ",
					"Kel'Thuzad descended deep into the cold earth and found his way down to the bottom of the glacier. There, in the endless cavern of ice and shadows, he prostrated himself before the Frozen Throne and offered his soul to the dark lord of the dead.",
					"The Lich King was pleased with his latest conscript. He promised Kel'Thuzad immortality and great power in exchange for his loyalty and obedience. Eager for dark knowledge and power, Kel'Thuzad accepted his first great mission: to go into the world of men and found a new religion that would worship the Lich King as a god.",
					"To help the archmage accomplish his mission, Ner'zhul left Kel'Thuzad's humanity intact. The aged yet still charismatic wizard was charged with using his powers of illusion and persuasion to lull the downtrodden, disenfranchised masses of Lordaeron into a state of trust and belief. Then, once he had their attention, he would offer them a new vision of what society could be - and a new figurehead to call their king.",
					"Kel'Thuzad returned to Lordaeron in disguise, and over the span of three years, he used his fortune and intellect to gather a clandestine brotherhood of like-minded men and women. The brotherhood, which he called the Cult of the Damned, promised its acolytes social equality and eternal life on Azeroth in exchange for their service and obedience to Ner'zhul. ",
					"As the months passed, Kel'Thuzad found many eager volunteers for his new cult amongst the tired, overburdened laborers of Lordaeron. It was surprisingly easy for Kel'Thuzad to achieve his goal: namely, to transfer the citizens' faith in the Holy Light into belief in Ner'zhul's dark shadow. As the Cult of the Damned grew in size and influence, Kel'Thuzad made sure to hide its workings from the authorities of Lordaeron.",
					"With Kel'Thuzad's success in Lordaeron, the Lich King made the final preparations for his assault against human civilization. Placing his plague-energies into a number of portable artifacts called plague-cauldrons, Ner'zhul ordered Kel'Thuzad to transport the cauldrons to Lordaeron, where they would be hidden within various cult-controlled villages. ",
					"The cauldrons, protected by the loyal cultists, would then act as plague-generators, sending the plague seeping out across the unsuspecting farmlands and cities of northern Lordaeron.",
					"The Lich King's plan worked perfectly. Many of Lordaeron's northern villages were contaminated almost immediately. Just as in Northrend, the citizens who contracted the plague died and arose as the Lich King's willing slaves. ",
					"The cultists under Kel'Thuzad were eager to die and be raised again in their dark lord's service. They exulted in the prospect of immortality through undeath. As the plague spread, more and more feral zombies arose in the northlands. Kel'Thuzad looked upon the Lich King's growing army and named it the Scourge, for soon it would march upon the gates of Lordaeron and scour humanity from the face of the world. ",

Ner'zhul, the former mentor of Gul'dan, rallied the remaining orc clans under his dark banner. Aided by the Shadowmoon clan, the old shaman planned to open a number of portals on Draenor that would lead the Horde to new, unspoiled worlds. ",

Under Ner'zhul's surgical command, the orcs quickly rounded up the artifacts that they needed and fled back to the safety of Draenor.",

He ordered General Turalyon and the archmage, Khadgar, to lead an expedition through the Dark Portal to put an end to the orcish threat once and for all. Turalyon and Khadgar's forces marched into Draenor and repeatedly clashed with Ner'zhul's clans upon the ravaged Hellfire Peninsula. ",

					"Ner'zhul finally opened his portals to other worlds, but he did not foresee the terrible price he would pay. The portals' tremendous energies began to tear the very fabric of Draenor apart. As Turalyon's forces fought desperately to return home to Azeroth, the world of Draenor began to buckle in upon itself. Grom Hellscream and Kilrogg Deadeye, realizing that Ner'zhul's mad plans would doom their entire race, rallied the remaining orcs and escaped back to the relative safety of Azeroth.",

Though it would cost their lives, and the lives of their companions, they knew that it was the only way to ensure Azeroth's survival. Even as Hellscream and Deadeye hacked their way through the human ranks in a desperate bid for freedom, the Dark Portal exploded behind them. For them, and the remaining orcs on Azeroth, there would be no going back.",
					"Ner'zhul and his loyal Shadowmoon clan passed through the largest of the newly created portals, as massive volcanic eruptions began to break Draenor's continents apart. The burning seas rose up and roiled the shattered landscape as the tortured world was finally consumed in a massive, apocalyptic explosion.",

That land mass, known as Kalimdor, was home to a number of disparate races and creatures, all vying for survival amongst the savage elements of the waking world. At the dark continent's center was a mysterious lake of incandescent energies.",
					"The lake, which would later be called the Well of Eternity, was the true heart of the world's magic and natural power. Drawing its energies from the infinite Great Dark beyond the world, the Well acted as a mystical fount, sending its potent energies out across the world to nourish life in all its wondrous forms.\r\n\r\nIn time, a primitive tribe of nocturnal humanoids cautiously made their way to the edges of the mesmerizing, enchanted lake.",
					"The feral, nomadic humanoids, drawn by the Well's strange energies, built crude homes upon its tranquil shores. Over time, the Well's cosmic power affected the strange tribe, making them strong, wise and virtually immortal. The tribe adopted the name Kaldorei, which meant -children of the stars- in their native tongue. To celebrate their budding society, they constructed great structures and temples around the lake's periphery.",
					"The Kaldorei, or night elves as they would later be known, worshipped the moon goddess, Elune, and believed that she slept within the Well's shimmering depths during the daylight hours. The early night elf priests and seers studied the Well with an insatiable curiosity, driven to plumb its untold secrets and power. As their society grew, the night elves explored the\r\nbreadth of Kalimdor and encountered its myriad denizens.",
					"The only creatures that gave them pause were the ancient and powerful dragons. Though\r\nthe great serpentine beasts were often reclusive, they did much to safeguard the known lands from potential threats. The night elves believed that the dragons held themselves to be the protectors of the world, and that they and their secrets were best left alone.",
					"In time, the night elves' curiosity led them to meet and befriend a number of powerful entities, not the least of which was Cenarius, a mighty demi-god of the primordial forestlands. The great-hearted Cenarius grew fond of the inquisitive night elves and spent a great deal of time teaching them about the natural world. The tranquil Kaldorei developed a strong empathy for the living forests of Kalimdor and reveled in the harmonious balance of nature.",
					"Yet, as the seemingly endless ages passed, the night elves' civilization expanded both territorially and culturally. Their temples, roads, and dwelling places stretched across the breadth of the dark continent. Azshara, the night elves' beautiful and gifted Queen, built an immense, wondrous palace on the Well's shore that housed her favored servitors within its bejeweled halls. ",
					"Her servitors, whom she called the Quel'dorei or -high-borne,- doted on her every command and believed themselves to be greater than the rest of their lower-caste brethren. Though Queen Azshara was loved equally by all of her people, the high-borne were secretly hated by the jealous masses.\r\n\r\nSharing the priests' curiosity towards the Well of Eternity, Azshara ordered the educated high-borne to plumb its secrets and reveal its true purpose in the world. ",
					"The high-borne buried themselves in their work and studied the Well ceaselessly. In time they developed the ability to manipulate and control the Well's cosmic energies. As their reckless experiments progressed, the high-borne found that they could use their newfound powers to either create or destroy at their leisure. The hapless high-borne had stumbled upon primitive magic and were now resolved to devote themselves to its mastery.",
					"Although they agreed that magic was inherently dangerous if handled irresponsibly, Azshara and her highborne began to practice their spellcraft with reckless abandon. Cenarius and many of the wizened night elf scholars warned that only calamity would result from toying with the clearly volatile arts of magic. But, Azshara and her followers stubbornly continued to expand their burgeoning powers.",
					"As their powers grew, a distinct change came over Azshara and the high-borne. The haughty, aloof upper class became increasingly callous and cruel towards their fellow night elves. A dark, brooding pall veiled Azshara's once entrancing beauty. She began to withdraw from her loving subjects and refused to interact with any but her trusted high-borne priests.",
					"A young, brazen scholar named Furion Stormrage, who had spent much of his time studying the Well's effects, began to suspect that a terrible power was corrupting the high-borne and his beloved Queen. Though he could not conceive the evil that was to come, he knew that the night elves' lives would soon be changed forever....",

Some elves, wary of the Kaldorei's ancient warnings, felt that their use of magic might possibly draw the attention of the banished Burning Legion. ",

They constructed a series of monolithic Runestones at various points around Quel'Thalas which marked the boundaries of the magic barrier. The Runestones not only masked the elves' magic from extra-dimensional threats, but helped to frighten away the superstitious troll warbands as well.",

"Madam Goya, the pleasure is all mine."  \r\n\r\nShe dipped in a polite bow; Marcus felt a sudden warmth as he was reminded why the term bouncy was often used to describe the Pandaren.

Marcus asked.  \r\n\r\n"There are several magnificent pieces of armor, a tiny companion, and even an exotic mount," Madam Goya answered, her typical playfulness quickly returning.  She paused and held a hand to her chin, feigning thoughtfulness.  "But my most valuable treasures are located upstairs."  \r\n\r\nMarcus\'s eyebrows lifted comically and his eyes widened before his expression settled into gleeful acceptance.

"What the..."\r\n\r\nTanda exclaimed, "Bax, no!"\r\n\r\nMarcus pulled his head away and gasped for air, looking at the angry tauren with wide eyes.

Bax forced his head up, grunting and spitting in anger, only to have it repeatedly pushed down.  They locked eyes for a moment, and with a final heave of explosive force, Bax wrenched himself free.\r\n\r\nThe powerful tauren swung his arms out wide, as if to crush Marcus in a mighty hug.  "Blades of Light!" proclaimed the paladin. A huge, pulsing sword thrust up from the ground between the two combatants, tearing through armor and clothing, searing the thick chest hair of Marcus and cutting a fine line into the tauren\'s muscular chest.\r\n\r\nBefore they could move again, Tanda raised her hooved leg into the air and brought it down with warlike force.  The man and bull wobbled, clearly stunned.  "Stop it, both of you!"',

We took advantage of a dense fog that cloaked our movements; no doubt they thought our numbers were much greater, hence they fled southeast by morning light.\n\nWe were astounded to discover a great cliff wall as the fog burned away. Land! It's not on any of our charts. I've messaged the Skyseeker in order to arrange for air support.",
					"Day 2\n\nThe Skyseeker has arrived and dispatched its gyrocopters. This is no mere uncharted island - we have discovered an entire continent! I will begin shuttling men and materials up the cliff walls immediately. From this higher ground, we will have a commanding view of the nearby seas.\n\nCommunication among the fleet is sporadic and confusing. The Horde seems to be everywhere at once; we have lost contact with Admiral Taylor's flagship, which likely engaged the Horde fleet we thumped a couple of days ago. Light help him; they were out or blood.\n\nWith no news from Stormwind, I am going to take the initiative and secure this land.",

The ruins and surrounding jungle are too dangerous for air traffic, we've been using some clearings to the south as a temporary airbase.\n\nThis morning we made our first contact with the natives. They are pandaren! I didn't think they were real. Could this be some sort of mythical pandaren homeland?",

The Horde will come back; I am certain of it. How many will come? Will they come by sea or by air? I must be ready!\n\nThe men are working double-time with half rations. The pandaren have offered food in trade but are not interested in Stormwind promissory notes and laugh at the quality of our steel. For some reason, this makes me furious. Do they know that they are about to be in the middle of a battlefield?",
					"Day 9\n\nThe Skyseeker reported that it picked up Horde prisoners from an engagement at sea this morning, then suddenly fell silent. I fear the worst.\n\nActually, I fear a lot of things. We're alone here. Reinforcements from Stormwind are weeks away. Taylor's flagship is missing, and now the Skyseeker is silent. Are we losing the war at sea? Doubts churn within me. I can't think straight. I swear my skin is losing color. What is wrong with me?",
					"Day 12\n\nEvery day I scan the horizon for Horde airships. We are not ready. Our airbase is in shambles, with a half-complete tower. Some pandaren have offered to help, and I've drafted them.\n\nYears ago, I once hunted down Colonel Kurzen when madness overtook him in Stranglethorn. I never understood his spiral into darkness until now. I am alone. At night I lie awake in the oppressive heat, and swear the shadows are whispering to me of my own demise. Must get that airbase finished. I'll clap the pandaren in manacles if I have to. The Horde... The Horde...",
					"Day 14\n\nWoke up to news of a signal flare from off the coast. There's a shadow moving through the fog. A horde gunship?\n\nI've dispatched a messenger to scramble the gyrocopters. They may not get here in time. Ordering everyone to the guns. This is it.\n\nI feel overpowered with anger and dread. I am not myself. Perhaps in victory I will find solace?\n\nIf it is truly a single Horde airship, then they stand no chance. We will decimate them.",

Portals, when used properly, are just as safe and certainly faster. HOWEVER, in practice portals have a history of being a burden on any society in which it is offered to the general public. Of all the major spells developed and maintained by the Kirin Tor (including polymorph), portal technology is the closest to becoming banished from anything but emergency usage.",
					"Why all the trouble? First, Ley Lines don't grow on trees. Massive traffic through a Line from all over Azeroth wears down the infrastructure and must be periodically replaced. We charge the mage for every portal via reagent taxes, and encourage mages to pass off these charges to those using the portal. But these taxes don't even begin to cover the time cost of replacing a Line, only the materials. \r\n",
					'Remember that a portal most used is a portal most efficient: More persons using a single portal causes no further stress to the Ley Lines, and is encouraged. A "Portalpooling" program is in the works that will give tax breaks to mages who create portals for no less than (5) persons. Read your latest issue of "Kirin Tor Monthly" to see the progress of the Portalpooling program. \r\n',
					"Second, while a properly used portal is just as safe as your average zeppelin trip (maybe more so considering the engineering practices of goblins), an improperly used portal can potentially yield dire results. Here is a list of immutable regulations for appropriate portal usage:\r\n",
					"Rule #1: Do not create a portal to anywhere but the designated Kirin Tor portal drop-off zones. The most dangerous aspect of the portal spell is its vast potential. We realize it's easy for a mage to create a door to anywhere, so our only way to combat such potentially deadly acts is to make it punishable by death. \r\nSpecial Issue License D-6 permits open portal usage, but is rarely issued. Speak with your local Portal Trainer about qualifying for this license. \r\n",
					"Rule #2: Create a portal in the proper place, and use it in the proper way. Do not create a portal beneath the feet of someone. Do not linger halfway in and out of a portal. The portal is not a garbage disposal. The portal is not a shield. Do not use a portal like an umbrella, or any kind of shelter from the elements. \r\n",
					'Do not back out of a portal after partially entering it. Do not try and "grab" the edges of the portal, either from the inside or the outside. A portal does not create "handlebars" to assist usage, and disruption of its boundaries is dangerous. \r\n',
					"Rule #3: Never force or trick anyone to go through a portal. Not only is this is a great way to lose repeat customers, it's also incredibly dangerous (See Rule #2). \r\n",
					'Rule #4: Do not have someone who is polymorphed enter a portal. This has yet to not cause an explosion. This is also covered in "Polymorphic Rules & Regulations."\r\n',
					'Rule #5: Do not remove the liquid filter from a portal spell. Portals innately prevent large amounts of flowing water through them so that they can be cast underwater. To allow for water elementals to use a portal, this filter can be omitted when casting. Do not omit this when underwater! We feel obligated to mention Moderately Severe Claims Disaster Case 34-zz: "The Great Lakeshire Drought & The Great Ironforge Flood of 24 A.D."\r\n',
					"Rule #6: Standard Portal dimensions are 3 yards, 1 foot, 3 and 3/4 inches tall, 2 yards, 8 feet, 9 and 15/16 inches wide. Double-wide portal creation requires Special Issue License G-16, and is commonly issued to mages with a clean portal record of 8 years or more.

I located an ideal setting by a freshwater river inlet.  Judging by the old, abandoned docks nearby, this site was inhabited sometime ago.  As for the original inhabitants, only time can tell that tale.",

I fought alongside Ajeck's father's side in many battles in defense of the Alliance.  Seeing her grown is quite special.  Her father schooled her well in the ways of weaponry.  Her skills with a bow make me wonder if there is elven blood running through those veins.",

He no longer wished to uphold the position that his father's bloodline had earned for him in the House of Nobles.\r\n\r\nBut I digress.  The purpose of this story is not to act as a political treatise or a biography.  This is the account of my experiences hunting big game in the green hills of Stranglethorn....",
					"We rose with the sun.  Barnil began to prepare the morning meal. I noticed Ajeck's attention was somewhat distracted.  The day's trek would be long and our hunt would bring us close to danger.  A lack of focus could easily lead to an errant mishap.  Yet Ajeck seemed unable to divert her gaze from Barnil who stood by the edge of the river rinsing out his mess kit.",
					"Just as I was about to question Ajeck's lack of interest in the day's hunting strategy, she reached for her quiver, drew an arrow and unleashed a shot right towards poor Barnil.  But it was not Barnil that Ajeck was shooting at.  For when Barnil stepped aside, mouth agape, a large river crocilisk floated to the surface with Ajeck's arrow perfectly placed between his two large eyes.",
					"We set out toward the west, through the thick overgrowth of the tangled jungle.  Moving with slow, deliberate steps we paced through thick foliage in search of prey.  The morning passed in frustrated silence.  Nothing was stirring in the Vale, not even a breeze.  By the afternoon, the expedition had grown restless.  Barnil no longer strode with the cautious steps of a predator tracking prey.  Rather he clumsily clomped along the path often stepping noisily on dried leaves or fallen branches.",
					"During one such misstep, Erlgadin laid a heavy hand on Barnil's shoulder.  Ajeck and I gave a casual glance, assuming the man was simply giving Barnil a much-needed scolding for his carelessness.  Erlgadin, however, gestured slowly with his head toward a nearby fallen tree.  Gazing back at us were two piercing black eyes just above a mouthful of razor sharp fangs.",
					"The beast was a male Stranglethorn Tiger.  Before I could cock my rifle, Erlgadin raised his crossbow and fired upon the beast.  The bolt missed its mark and caught the beast heavily in the left flank.  The tiger made a futile attempt to flee but its wound was too grave.  The beast stumbled for a few tragic seconds until Barnil finished the kill with a thrown axe.",
					"The kill brought about a festive mood amongst the expedition.  Barnil poured mead for all to enjoy.  But our festivities were short-lived.  As we were preparing the corpse for transport back to base camp we were all caught off guard by a horrendous growl.  In all my years I have never heard anything so blood curdling.",
					"On a rocky precipice above, silhouetted by the setting sun, I could make out the largest cat of prey I have ever laid eyes upon.  I was able to loose one clumsy volley with my rifle, but the cat held his ground.  He growled once again, this time louder than the first, and vanished.\r\n\r\nWe gathered our belongings and headed solemnly back to camp.",
					"I had promised the expedition that we would spend the next day hunting panthers, as their furs are in high demand throughout Azeroth.  It only makes sense that such demand should exist with all of the able-bodied hunters, trappers and fur-traders off giving their lives so valiantly in the name of the Alliance.",
					"Ajeck and Sir Erlgadin were anxious to learn how to hunt effectively with a Dwarven Rifle.  I had the two humans leave their primitive range weapons at base camp.  Barnil and I outfitted them with some of Ironforge's finest firearms.",
					"On this day we ventured to the south, following some fresh panther tracks.  Soon we reached a ravine spanned by a tremendous rope bridge.  I could not help but to think of Brann's descriptive writings of this region when I saw the engineering marvel.  So often it was assumed that the native Trolls were a primitive and uneducated race yet as I gazed upon the master craftsmanship of the bridge I was able to recognize the skill with which the Troll builders overcame the seemingly impossible feat.",
					"Before long, Ajeck tracked the panther to the southwest.  We walked quietly, guns at the ready, in anticipation of our prey.  A snapping of twigs from a nearby copse of trees drew our attention immediately.  Something was in there.  One stern glance at Barnil was enough to convey my thoughts.  Barnil slowly lowered his rifle.  This kill was not for us; it was for our Human companions.  Countless panthers had lost their lives in front of our smoking barrels.  This kill would be for the Humans.",
					"Both Ajeck and Sir Erlgadin stood poised, guns leveled at the bristling overgrowth at the base of the swaying trees.  The midday sun beat heavily upon us.  A slow trickle of perspiration trailed down from Elrgadin's temple as he pulled the pin back.  Upon the sound of the click, the thick flora parted and a large black panther -- a beautiful specimen -- darted out onto the plain.",
					"The Humans trained their sights on the panther as it ran along the edge of the tree line.  The barrels of their guns moved in perfect parallel tandem.  Barnil gave me an urging glance but I shook my head no.  This hunt was for the Humans, not Barnil or me.  Erlgadin fired a booming shot, missing the panther altogether.  Apparently he was unprepared for the violent kickback of the rifle blast.",
					"His gun tossed back violently in his arms.  The barrel swooped sideways and came up beneath Ajeck's rifle.  Ajeck had chosen that exact moment to pull her trigger.  The rifle, the aim now knocked clumsily toward the tree line, went off with a distinct boom.  A flock of birds screamed out of the canopy, scattering in every direction.  A plume of smoke rose from the tree.  We watched in awe as a tremendous branch fell squarely on the fleeing panther, breaking its back",
					"As the weeks passed our stockpile of panther and tiger skins grew immense.  I decided it was time for the expedition to shift our focus to a new challenge: Raptors.\r\n\r\nThe Humans, while appreciative of the training Barnil and I offered, decided to refrain from hunting with firearms.  Ajeck was much more comfortable with a finely strung bow and Sir Erlgadin never left camp without his sturdy crossbow.",
					"We set out at first light, heading south past the Tkashi Ruins.  Barnil voiced concern that we might encounter members of the Bloodscalp Tribe.  I reminded Barnil that the Bloodscalps were more concerned with destroying their tribal enemy, the Skullsplitters.  Needless to say, Barnil was not comforted in the least.  I, however, had a loaded rifle, a satchel full of gunpowder and three deadly hunters with me to ease any concerns of an unfriendly ambush.",
					"I've stood before a towering Infernal on the battlefield, the army of the Burning Legion advancing from all directions.  An unruly band of Trolls seems as harmless as a jackrabbit in the hills of Dun Morogh.\r\n\r\nWe passed the Tkashi Ruins without event, much to Barnil's relief.  The party proceeded to head westward, toward the Great Sea, skirting the Ruins of Zul'Kunda just to the south.  As we ascended the high sea bluffs we spotted our first Raptor.",
					"The beast never so much as detected our presence.  In fact, the only greeting he received from the expedition was a bullet between the eyes.\r\n\r\nSir Erlgadin let out a hearty *hurrah* as Ajeck nodded toward me with keen approval.  I sifted through my pack in search of my pipe, hoping to enjoy a celebratory smoke.  Barnil began to scurry up the hillside to retrieve the Raptor's corpse.  I stared at the fallen beast with the satisfaction that accompanies every big kill.",
					"But I could not bask in the glory of the kill for long.  For when I turned my eyes toward the horizon, several silhouettes appeared cresting the hill, just above poor Barnil.\r\n\r\n*Flee, Barnil!* I shouted.  Ajeck, Sir Erlgadin and myself loosed a volley of bullets, arrows and bolts over Barnil and toward the pursuing raptors.  One of us landed a kill amidst the confusion.",
					"Our hastily aimed shots were enough to buy Barnil's escape.  Barnil clamored back down the hill and rejoined the party. We scurried off into the jungle; a pack of ferocious Lashtail Raptors stalking our every move.  \r\n\r\nThe hunters were now the hunted.",
					"I led the party toward the sea, hoping the shoreline would provide refuge from the Raptors.  In our haste we had drifted too far north, to a precariously high elevation.  The mistake was made.  The fault was mine.  We stopped just short of a sheer cliff, the Raptors just a few paces behind.",
					"I stepped slowly forward, gun raised.  I had led these brave hunters to their death.  I would die defending them.  Lashtail Raptors are particularly fierce, known for their unrelenting blood-thirst.  They far outnumbered us.  But I would be damned if I let them kill me and my comrades without shedding some of their own blood first.",
					"Ajeck and Sir Erlgadin readied their weapons, flanking me on either side, our backs to the sea.  Barnil let out a defeated sigh and drew his axe.  The Lashtails were almost upon us.  Their steady stride had slowed.  They were stalking their prey now for they knew they had us trapped.",
					"And then something miraculous happened.  From off to our side we heard the distinct and terrifying roar of the great white tiger.  Despite their numbers, the Raptors turned and scattered in all directions.  We saw but a brief white flash as the tiger darted past us and pounced on one of the Raptors.  No command needed to be given.  All four members of our party knew it was time to run.",
					"We sprinted all the way back to base camp, never slowing.  Later that night we sat quietly around the campfire, knowing our lives had been saved by a bizarre twist of fate.  Such are the risks of the big game hunter.  We toy with fate by delivering it.  Yet each of us, at some point, will face fate's razor sharp teeth.  This Dwarf is just glad that moment did not come upon the green hills of Stranglethorn.\r\n\r\n--The End--",

					"Once upon a time there lived a mage who could not cast fireball, polymorph, or frostbolt. When he conjured water, it came out as mud. His attempts at arcane intellect made the subjects stupider. Without any doubt, his tutors agreed that their pupil, Bungledorf, was the worst mage in Dalaran.",
					"Bungledorf had come to learn with great hopes. He guzzled mana potions before class, mistakenly believing they would increase his skill. But all they ever increased was the number of times he accidentally burped during important invocations, often setting classmates' robes ablaze or turning his teacher's beard into sheep's wool in the process.",
					"At his first exam, Bungledorf was asked to cast frost armor correctly. The other students shifted in their seats fearfully as he began the incantation. A blue fog encompassed the young lad and for a moment it looked as though he had succeeded. But then he began to shiver and sneeze violently, and everyone finally realized: he had given himself frostbite.",
					'One day Bungledorf was in the park, wondering whether he was cut out to be a mage. He saw some children playing nearby and remembered his dream of being a powerful spellcaster. "Yes," he thought, "I can do it; I just need to try harder!" He looked for something to practice on and noticed an unusual tree before him. Summoning his courage, Bungledorf began casting a spell on it. He shut his eyes, afraid to see the result...',
					'When he finally looked, the tree was replaced with a beautiful night elf. "It worked!" he cried, "It\'s transformed! I am a mage after all!"\r\n\r\nThe night elf was confused for a moment and then smiled at him gently. "I am a druid, young one. We take other forms by our own will."',
					"Bungledorf blushed and stepped away, only to trip over his robes and fall headfirst into the lawn. A chorus of giggles greeted him as he adjusted his long pointed cap and shuffled off toward the dormitory, his head hanging low.",
					"The night elf lingered, pondering the boy. When she turned to leave, she caught her foot in something, and nearly lost her balance. Surprised at the unfamiliar obstacle, she looked down to see a glistening crop of mageroyal, its petals slowly unfurling into full bloom, where moments ago there had been nothing. She wondered at this, and then, realizing, turned back in the direction Bungledorf had been walking, but the young mage was already gone.",

I located an ideal setting by a freshwater river inlet.  Judging by the old, abandoned docks nearby, this site was inhabited sometime ago.  As for the original inhabitants, only time can tell that tale.",
					"For this expedition I have assembled Ajeck Rouack and Sir S. J Erlgadin, along with my trusted servant, Barnil Stonepot.  I fought alongside Ajeck's father's side in many battles in defense of the Alliance.  Seeing her grown is quite special.  Her father schooled her well in the ways of weaponry.  Her skills with a bow make me wonder if there is elven blood running through those veins.",

He no longer wished to uphold the position that his father's bloodline had earned for him in the House of Nobles.\r\n\r\nBut I digress.  The purpose of this story is not to act as a political treatise or a biography.  This is the account of my experiences hunting big game in the green hills of Stranglethorn....",
					"We rose with the sun.  Barnil began to prepare the morning meal. I noticed Ajeck's attention was somewhat distracted.  The day's trek would be long and our hunt would bring us close to danger.  A lack of focus could easily lead to an errant mishap.  Yet Ajeck seemed unable to divert her gaze from Barnil who stood by the edge of the river rinsing out his mess kit.",
					"Just as I was about to question Ajeck's lack of interest in the day's hunting strategy, she reached for her quiver, drew an arrow and unleashed a shot right towards poor Barnil.  But it was not Barnil that Ajeck was shooting at.  For when Barnil stepped aside, mouth agape, a large river crocilisk floated to the surface with Ajeck's arrow perfectly placed between his two large eyes.",
					"We set out toward the west, through the thick overgrowth of the tangled jungle.  Moving with slow, deliberate steps we paced through thick foliage in search of prey.  The morning passed in frustrated silence.  Nothing was stirring in the Vale, not even a breeze.  By the afternoon, the expedition had grown restless.  Barnil no longer strode with the cautious steps of a predator tracking prey.  Rather he clumsily clomped along the path often stepping noisily on dried leaves or fallen branches.",
					"During one such misstep, Erlgadin laid a heavy hand on Barnil's shoulder.  Ajeck and I gave a casual glance, assuming the man was simply giving Barnil a much-needed scolding for his carelessness.  Erlgadin, however, gestured slowly with his head toward a nearby fallen tree.  Gazing back at us were two piercing black eyes just above a mouthful of razor sharp fangs.",
					"The beast was a male Stranglethorn Tiger.  Before I could cock my rifle, Erlgadin raised his crossbow and fired upon the beast.  The bolt missed its mark and caught the beast heavily in the left flank.  The tiger made a futile attempt to flee but its wound was too grave.  The beast stumbled for a few tragic seconds until Barnil finished the kill with a thrown axe.",

A slow trickle of perspiration trailed down from Elrgadin's temple as he pulled the pin back.  Upon the sound of the click, the thick flora parted and a large black panther -- a beautiful specimen -- darted out onto the plain.",
					"The Humans trained their sights on the panther as it ran along the edge of the tree line.  The barrels of their guns moved in perfect parallel tandem.  Barnil gave me an urging glance but I shook my head no.  This hunt was for the Humans, not Barnil or me.  Erlgadin fired a booming shot, missing the panther altogether.  Apparently he was unprepared for the violent kickback of the rifle blast.",
					"His gun tossed back violently in his arms.  The barrel swooped sideways and came up beneath Ajeck's rifle.  Ajeck had chosen that exact moment to pull her trigger.  The rifle, the aim now knocked clumsily toward the tree line, went off with a distinct boom.  A flock of birds screamed out of the canopy, scattering in every direction.  A plume of smoke rose from the tree.  We watched in awe as a tremendous branch fell squarely on the fleeing panther, breaking its back",
					"As the weeks passed our stockpile of panther and tiger skins grew immense.  I decided it was time for the expedition to shift our focus to a new challenge: Raptors.\r\n\r\nThe Humans, while appreciative of the training Barnil and I offered, decided to refrain from hunting with firearms.  Ajeck was much more comfortable with a finely strung bow and Sir Erlgadin never left camp without his sturdy crossbow.",
					"We set out at first light, heading south past the Tkashi Ruins.  Barnil voiced concern that we might encounter members of the Bloodscalp Tribe.  I reminded Barnil that the Bloodscalps were more concerned with destroying their tribal enemy, the Skullsplitters.  Needless to say, Barnil was not comforted in the least.  I, however, had a loaded rifle, a satchel full of gunpowder and three deadly hunters with me to ease any concerns of an unfriendly ambush.",
					"I've stood before a towering Infernal on the battlefield, the army of the Burning Legion advancing from all directions.  An unruly band of Trolls seems as harmless as a jackrabbit in the hills of Dun Morogh.\r\n\r\nWe passed the Tkashi Ruins without event, much to Barnil's relief.  The party proceeded to head westward, toward the Great Sea, skirting the Ruins of Zul'Kunda just to the south.  As we ascended the high sea bluffs we spotted our first Raptor.",
					"The beast never so much as detected our presence.  In fact, the only greeting he received from the expedition was a bullet between the eyes.\r\n\r\nSir Erlgadin let out a hearty *hurrah* as Ajeck nodded toward me with keen approval.  I sifted through my pack in search of my pipe, hoping to enjoy a celebratory smoke.  Barnil began to scurry up the hillside to retrieve the Raptor's corpse.  I stared at the fallen beast with the satisfaction that accompanies every big kill.",
					"But I could not bask in the glory of the kill for long.  For when I turned my eyes toward the horizon, several silhouettes appeared cresting the hill, just above poor Barnil.\r\n\r\n*Flee, Barnil!* I shouted.  Ajeck, Sir Erlgadin and myself loosed a volley of bullets, arrows and bolts over Barnil and toward the pursuing raptors.  One of us landed a kill amidst the confusion.",
					"Our hastily aimed shots were enough to buy Barnil's escape.  Barnil clamored back down the hill and rejoined the party. We scurried off into the jungle; a pack of ferocious Lashtail Raptors stalking our every move.  \r\n\r\nThe hunters were now the hunted.",
					"I led the party toward the sea, hoping the shoreline would provide refuge from the Raptors.  In our haste we had drifted too far north, to a precariously high elevation.  The mistake was made.  The fault was mine.  We stopped just short of a sheer cliff, the Raptors just a few paces behind.",
					"I stepped slowly forward, gun raised.  I had led these brave hunters to their death.  I would die defending them.  Lashtail Raptors are particularly fierce, known for their unrelenting blood-thirst.  They far outnumbered us.  But I would be damned if I let them kill me and my comrades without shedding some of their own blood first.",
					"Ajeck and Sir Erlgadin readied their weapons, flanking me on either side, our backs to the sea.  Barnil let out a defeated sigh and drew his axe.  The Lashtails were almost upon us.  Their steady stride had slowed.  They were stalking their prey now for they knew they had us trapped.",
					"And then something miraculous happened.  From off to our side we heard the distinct and terrifying roar of the great white tiger.  Despite their numbers, the Raptors turned and scattered in all directions.  We saw but a brief white flash as the tiger darted past us and pounced on one of the Raptors.  No command needed to be given.  All four members of our party knew it was time to run.",
					"We sprinted all the way back to base camp, never slowing.  Later that night we sat quietly around the campfire, knowing our lives had been saved by a bizarre twist of fate.  Such are the risks of the big game hunter.  We toy with fate by delivering it.  Yet each of us, at some point, will face fate's razor sharp teeth.  This Dwarf is just glad that moment did not come upon the green hills of Stranglethorn.\r\n\r\n--The End--",

					'Entry 1\n\nFor the first time in the last decade I feel like I have a proper lead. There was an ancient scroll written in a strange language that talked about the Pools of Youth. It would appear to pre-date Azshara\'s rule.\n\nThe odd part is the language is neither elves nor trolls. This fascinating bit of news would imply that there were societies older than that of our own on Azeroth.\n\nFrom what I could decipher, the Pools of Youth were actually the property of an ancient dynasty. What race comprised this dynasty still remains a mystery.\n\nThere is something sinister about the writings of this "Dojani dynasty" however. There are also references to an imperial seat and a valley of golden blossoms. \n\nThe choice bit of news is that they included coordinates to their kingdom\'s "heart of power." I should be able to have one of our new arcane mages provide us a portal if I can convince Tyrande to approve the mission.',
					'Entry 2\n\nTyrande is a stubborn unruly woman! Far be it for me to speak against my high priestess but she is a buffoon, unwilling to take even the most minor of risks.\n\nI showed her my research! I showed her how to find the Pools of Youth and the legacy of this ancient empire. What does she do? Deems the mission "too risky." \n\nHow is the mortality of our people to be dismissed as "too risky"? Oh she insists that we made the right choice setting aside our immortality when we had to save Azeroth. But I believe that is a fixable issue. \n\nThere is more than one way to live forever!',
					'Entry 3\n\nTyrande is a goddess! She approved my mission! Granted, she insisted I take my daughter and nearly a battalion of sentinels with me but no matter. I can proceed.\n\nIt would seem her ladyship was beset by dreams and visions of the same golden valley I told her of in my research. \n\nFor her, the visions gave her a sense of healing and a need for peace. But her visions also had something about danger and "gets worse before it gets better" type of warnings. \n\nThe scrolls my research came from spoke of a peaceful land as well so I am not sure what she is so concerned about.',
					"Entry 4\n\nI think my daughter is annoyed she has been assigned to keep me safe. Lyalia is a sweet girl but she has never appreciated my research. \n\nIt is a shame she is so headstrong. Probably gets it from her mother. I have tried to explain to her that if I succeed we will have all of eternity to spend time together. \n\n She really is but a child, born only within the last century. She seems quite upset that i don't pay enough attention to her. But what is twenty years spent in research when compared to millennia of conversation and experiences that would follow?",
					"Entry 5\n\nAn arcanic oubliette. Who would build such a sinister device? \n\n By my estimates this contraption is almost twelve thousand years old and yet it still had enough power to trip.\n\nApparently, once tripped, it begins to draw energy off of all those trapped within it, using their life force to power the device much like a warlock siphons life off their victims. \n\nMost civilized cities just use wards to prevent unwanted portals. \n\n This, this is something very dark. It would seem the civilization that made this has no qualms about siphoning or redistributing life.",

Illusion can be used for disguise or manipulation, but beware, spells to counteract illusions exist in the divination school. It is not viable to base your entire career on illusionary magic.",
					"Contrary to popular belief, illusions are far more than mere parlor tricks. The spell of invisibility is among the most integral in a battle mage's repertoire, as you will often find yourself in dangerous situations and in need of a quick method for a strategic retreat. Illusions can also be used to deceive your opponents into thinking that you are elsewhere, or even trick your enemies into fighting each other. This is no easy task, but the accomplished illusionist can turn allies into enemies - and his or her own enemies into allies.",
					"The former archmage Jandace Barov - may her soul rest in peace - was an excellent example of a talented illusionist. In life, she developed a spell that displayed several images of her body that were nearly indistinguishable from her real form. These images duplicated her actions from different locations, making it nearly impossible for her enemies to find her. It was almost infallible. Which brings me to another lesson - almost is simply not good enough.",

Winter set in and still we had learned nothing about the enemy. Frustrated, we turned homeward.",
					"Ascending the final hill revealed a terrifying vista. The village lay burnt and deformed. I ran to our house. A makeshift bolt had been nailed across the outside of the door.

I turned away in anguish, and beheld the gashes in the door where they had clawed in panic. The smallest scratches had belonged to the youngest.",

By now, Instructor Razuvious has likely begun teaching you the first lessons of what it means to be a death knight.  Allow me to begin your instruction on what is perhaps the most guarded treasure in a death knight's possession; the runeblade.\r\n\r\n",

For just as you, young death knight are the extension through which the Lich King imposes his will, so is your runeblade the instrument that has been granted the honor in delivering this authority.  Of this authority, understand these principles:\r\n",
					"1.) United, your runeblade becomes an extension of your very body.  And your body belongs to the Lich King.\n\n\r\n2.) As one, your runeblade becomes your will manifest in physical form.  And your will is that of the Lich King.\n\n\r\n3.) Together, your runeblade becomes the vein through which death itself is delivered to your soul.  And your soul shall deliver the will of the Lich King. \r\n",
					"Through the course of your training, you may find yourself compelled to focus upon some of the different disciplines of study available to our kind.  On this matter I can only say this; all are worthy of study and to neglect some at the cost of others is a foolish pride that I have seen cost other, less capable death knights in battle their lives.\r\n",
					"It is likely that some of you may soon find your runeblade to be a particularly potent object through which to channel your own fury.  However, this is not enough.  Do not be content to believe that your runeblade is simply a mere tool to focus one's meditation.  No, it is far more than that.  The most powerful of our kind have been able to command the power of their blade with but a simple extension of their will.  Together they fight, of singular mind, body, and purpose to crush any foolish enough to stand in their way.\r\n",

The same power that permeates our glorious citadel of Icecrown is yours to command, death knight.  Should you choose to master this discipline, there shall be no escape for your enemies, as they find their actions slowed and made impossible by the cold.\r\n",
					"Still others may find their true calling in mastering the power of their blades to bring about disease and plague in crushing our enemies.  This too is a specialty unique to our kind and worthy of pursuit.  The mightiest of defenses may seem impregnable at first, yet for every defense therein lies the weakness that it is covering.  It is simply a matter of uncovering it.  Never forget, death knight, that it was not an army, but a plague that brought about the destruction of Lordaeron.\r\n",

She named him Lo, and they became fast friends.",

The townsfolk shunned Jiang, and begged for her to get rid of Lo before he became old enough to hurt her.\n\nOne day, the Zandalari army had pushed as far south as the Jade Forest. Monsters from the sea, these trolls launched an attack against Pandaria. Jiang answered the call to arms, and defended her people on the beaches.",

Just as the weapon was inches from her heart, Lo came to the rescue.\n\nThe serpent, only half grown, swooped in and ripped the troll limb from limb. He then gathered up the wounded Jiang and flew her far from the battle to safety.\n\nWhen she was well enough, Jiang approached the leaders of Pandaria's defenses. These were the great warrior monks who defended the land from the trolls and other dangers.",
					"She tried to explain to them how serpents could help, how Lo had saved her, how she knew how to turn the tide of battle.\n\nBut her words fell on deaf ears. The monks were mired in their own wisdom, and chose to continue their defense in the way they sought fit. \n\nJiang did not give up though. This rejection only fueled her resolve.",
					"Several days later, the Zandalari had pushed in from the coast. It was on the great bridge near Dawn's Blossom that the pandaren champions stood their ground. With an effort they tried to hold back the trolls, and were losing. The Zandalari numbers were vast, and their bat riders fought in such a way the pandaren had no counter to. All hope of victory began to fade.",

Soon Ji was training other pandaren how to ride as she did, upon the backs of other serpents.",

				["text"] = {
					"The Decree of the Scourge\r\nChapter 1\r\nBy Kel'Thuzad\r\n\r\nThe roots of the Scourge are sewn in the folly of all races. Our rise to power is the product of the sins of those who mean our end. The so called 'heroes' of the land fall before us by resorting to a measure of our ideals to bring forth their envisioned victory. Their victory is a vehicle to the realization that without resorting to what they define as deplorability to achieve it, we would have overcome them instead. In both outcomes, win or lose, the Scourge invariably wins. When this is recognized, submission to our will is inevitable.\r\n",
					"The Master, our Lich King, was born under this very same doctrine.\r\n\r\nTo conquer is to corrupt. To corrupt is to take what it is to be righteous and hopeful, to be living, and invert it through any means in your arsenal. The attributes of the living all have synonyms with fatal flaws that are their undoing: hope is dogma, righteousness is zealotry, living is empathy. Recognize what makes that which lives desire to live, and turn it upon itself.\r\n",
					"Knowing the most direct path of corruption is the pinnacle of wisdom. A simple weakening of the heart, dismemberment of vital organs, or direct disease will work for most. However the conquer of most is not the decree of the Master, but the conquer of all. It is foolish to spend excessive resources in warping the mind of a simple peasant where common plague will suffice, but it is equally unwise to try the same common plague against the seasoned and hearty. Regimented study of any formidability will reveal useable weaknesses. \r\n",
					"The Decree of the Scourge\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\nThe largest misconception the living have of the Scourge is our penchant for what is considered 'evil.' For the sake of demoralization we allow this error to perpetuate, and indeed spread it on our own. The true nature of The Scourge is our transcendence of the shackles that keep any of the living races from becoming as prosperous as we. \r\n",
					"For example: What benefits do emotion and honor really hold? They serve to validate the living, to make them feel 'good.' Now, what flaws do they hold? Emotion is directly correlated to the ignorance of logic and reason. Honor is, at most times, the sole perpetuator of able resources fighting a losing battle. It is baffling even to me that the living can be so unaware of how eager we are to play the part of their villain, to nurture their greatest flaws by becoming the embodiment of all that incites irrational behavior.\r\n",
					"Moral ambiguity cannot be 'cleansed.' Antipathy cannot be 'healed' or 'assuaged.' Greed cannot be 'dispelled' and wrath cannot be 'cured.' We choose to be the embodiment of all these things, and yet there are some still foolish enough to believe that the Scourge can be defeated and removed completely. So long as the most attractive sins of the living remain our banner flag, there will always be those eager to flock to our will.  \r\n\r\nI myself was born under this doctrine.\r\n",
					"The Decree of the Scourge\r\nChapter 3\r\n\r\nThe Scourge is infinite in potential. We are not, however, infallible by any means. Always be well aware of your limits, and the resources at your disposal. Always have an exit strategy. Sacrifice of eager minions to your ends is a cornerstone of Scourge philosophy. All manner of bravery, martyrdom, or compatriotism for anyone but the Master is imprudent and severely punishable.\r\n\r\n",
					"Another fallacy outsiders hold of the Scourge is that our power resides in the residual will of the living, that we are an advanced form of parasite, and without a host of regenerating life would simply wither away. Again we do not deny such ignorant thought for our benefit, but this could not be further from the truth. We are nothing but an ever-improving form of adaptation to a land once riddled with endless struggle. We are immune to the tribulations of dissention, over-population, individuality, selfish opinion, short-sightedness, and even mortality. We hear the will of the Master, and the Master brings us all that we will ever desire. \r\n",
					"It is true that we take architecture, technology, and physical prowess from assimilated cultures. This, like the so many 'evil' acts of the Scourge, is done entirely out of pragmatism. The Scourge has neither the time nor the desire to generate a culture of its own. A member of the Scourge that creates without influence will hold an inherent attachment to it, a right to see it viewed and used. This leads to individuality, which leads to dissention. Creativity is a flaw of culture, but a minor obligation when dealing with simple needs like buildings and equipment. It is not your duty to question or care of the origins of your resources, only in how usable they are.\r\n",
					"The Scourge is the will of the land. All manner of life kneel to our will with an ease that yields a single conclusion: That they need us, they yearn for our salvation. There is no resilience to our practices, no immunity to our commandments. We are every bit the inevitability that a natural life holds: Death. Death comes with every life, and undeath comes with every death. The sooner the living recognizes this immutable fact, the easier their transition will be.\r\n",

In these mountains we shall build a prison for him to stand upon for all of time. From this pinnacle, he shall watch and bask in his failure, as you and your children shall serve my empire as slaves."',
					"And so Xuen was placed at the pinnacle of Kun-Lai Summit and made to watch as the pandaren and hozen were made slaves. But the tiger never submitted to Lei Shen's torture. In captivity, he grew stronger. His failure was a lesson, his pride now in check, and he waited for the day when a young pandaren slave would dare to challenge the might of the mogu emperors.",

There should be some noticeable improvement within the next few hours.\r\n",

All of the subjects are showing a milky coloring in their eyes.\r\n",

Word has spread among the apprentices that this disease may be magical in nature; the masters were quick to quash the rumors.

No one should suffer as these men have suffered. I plan to stay with them until the end.\r\n",

Only a few minutes after the last one breathed his last breath something horrifying happened.

Once the initial confusion passed one of the masters organized a force to deal with the animated bodies. The undead quickly fell to our combined arcane might.\r\n",

Shortly afterward guards arrived and escorted myself and the other apprentices to our rooms. I tried to learn what was going on but they would not answer me.

					"24 hours later\r\n\r\nI have been awake for over twenty-four hours now. I am exhausted but my room is too cold to sleep. I managed to complete a sending and contact a couple of the other apprentices who are trapped in their rooms. Through them I was able to learn what has the citadel on high alert. The masters are organizing search parties to locate the necromancer who was responsible for animating the corpses of the diseased farmers.\r\n",

					"We have resumed our efforts to learn more about the disease. Work has been slow due to most of the bodies having been obliterated. The masters have called in Lady Jaina Proudmoore to aid in our research. She will teleport here by the end of the day. I hear she is quite beautiful; hopefully working with Lady Proudmoore with help me keep my mind off of this damned cold.\r\n",

Sky-Captain Elaena Lancekat drew her saber and pointed with the blade for effect. She struck an imposing silhouette in her captain\'s finery amongst the web encrusted plate of her troops. "Do not fall prey to their games. We don\'t run from their trap! We lean into it!" \r\n\r\nUpon hearing this, the line of warriors and paladins cheered, readying their weapons.',

Several nerubians were taken by surprise and lost their grip, plunging into the Undersea. Sky-Captain Lancekat rushed to the railings. "Gunners! Pick those surviving nerubians off before they get to the inflatable! Ardents, burn through those webs with the Sacred Flame! Man the cannons!" The crew jumped to action.

But never for a moment did Ra and his allies hesitate. Under the guidance of Aman\'Thul and the other titans, the noble giants defeated the Old Gods and shackled them in prisons buried deep under the earth.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nRa accomplished many feats during this war.

The victory was momentous, but it also presented a unique challenge. The spirits of the elemental lords were bound to Azeroth. If the titan-forged destroyed them, they would eventually manifest on the world again. To prevent this, Highkeeper Ra decided to imprison the destructive beings. \r\n<BR/><BR/>"He worked alongside the titan-forged sorceress Helya to create a pocket dimension that would be known as the Elemental Plane. It included four domains, representing the four elements: fire, air, earth, and water. Into this prison realm, Ra and Helya banished the elemental lords and almost all of their servants.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"Ra and Helya crafted a shield, the Highkeeper\'s Ward, to act as a key to the Elemental Plane.

Among them were the mighty stone-skinned mogu. Led by Ra, they journeyed to the southern reaches of the world and began their long guardianship. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAman\'Thul and his fellow titans closely watched these events unfold. Confident that Azeroth was safe in the hands of their servants, they eventually departed the world.\r\n<BR/><BR/>On a stormy day, Ra and his mogu followers ascended a colossal mountain to see the titans off. The legends say that the Highkeeper slammed his weapon against his shield, and the elements answered to his will. The rains ceased and the clouds parted. The mountain at their feet rose higher, and lightning and fire illuminated the skies so that Ra and his followers could better glimpse the titans. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nLastly, the winds howled a sorrowful farewell.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

It weakened their stone forms and transformed them into creatures of flesh and blood. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"The mogu fragmented into warring clans. For years upon years, they fought each other for control of Azeroth\'s southern lands. From this crucible of violence, one mogu emerged and forged his people into an empire.\r\n<BR/><BR/>"His name was Lei Shen, the Thunder King, and his strength was without equal. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"Many tales exist about how Lei Shen acquired his power. The most widely accepted theory is that he stole it from a legendary being named Ra-den, which means "Master Ra" in the mogu tongue.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"But what of this creature\'s fabled artifacts, the Fist of Ra-den and the Highkeeper\'s Ward?

His inability to do so infuriated him. After all, Lei Shen had conquered the mogu and forged them into an empire. He had defeated Ra. How could two artifacts defy his will?\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut defy him they did. The shield and the fist weapon were simply too much even for the Thunder King to control. Every time he tried to use the artifacts, elemental energies lashed out at Lei Shen and overwhelmed him.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nDespite these repeated failures, Lei Shen did not give up. One way or another, he would harness the power of these ancient weapons.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Fist of Ra-den, Part Eight</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nLei Shen gave the Fist of Ra-den and the Highkeeper\'s Ward to a gifted blacksmith, Forgemaster Deng. The Thunder King ordered him to unlock the artifacts\' secrets, but he also warned the artisan not to harness their power for himself, or he would suffer grave consequences.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nDeng promised Lei Shen that he would follow his command, but he secretly plotted to disobey his master. The blacksmith reasoned that if he could find a way to use the weapon and the shield, something the Thunder King had been unable to do, he could take control over the mogu empire himself.\r\n<BR/><BR/>While Deng was tampering with the Fist of Ra-den, a bolt of lightning tore down from the sky and slammed into him. The artifact absorbed most of the energy, which saved the blacksmith\'s life. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut Deng did not escape unharmed.

He used the two artifacts to power an immense engine known as the Thunder Forge. This machine churned day and night, creating armaments of exceptional quality for the mogu military.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nLei Shen was pleased by the work, and he ordered Deng to personally craft him weapons and armor that would put all others to shame. The blacksmith toiled over the Thunder Forge to satisfy his master. Deng\'s labors gave rise to what would be his three greatest creations: a massive spear, a battleaxe, and a mighty helm.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

The world changed.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nA race known as the pandaren came to power in the lands once lorded over by the mogu. The new rulers governed with wisdom and benevolence, unlike Lei Shen and his brutal kin. Under the pandaren, an era of relative peace and prosperity settled over the region. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThousands of years after the fall of the mogu empire, a group of pandaren guardians called the Shado-Pan discovered the artifacts that had powered the Thunder Forge. These explorers were led by Master Wan Snowdrift, who was unaware of the dangerous energies stored in the items he had found.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSnowdrift took up the Fist of Ra-den, and he was immediately struck by a spear of lightning that seared his flesh and scarred his body.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

He and the other Shado-Pan feared that the weapon and its counterpart shield could do grave harm to the world if they fell into the wrong hands. To prevent this, they took the artifacts to Xuen, the White Tiger.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe White Tiger was one of the August Celestials, ancient and incredibly powerful creatures revered by the pandaren. Wise Xuen agreed with the Shado-Pan\'s assessment of the weapon and the shield. He secured them within his lair, the Temple of the White Tiger, where they would be safe.\r\n<BR/><BR/>Yet Xuen did not plan to keep them there forever. He knew the history of the artifacts. Though the mogu had used them for evil, the titan Aman\'Thul had originally created them for good. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nXuen believed it was only a matter of time before a mortal arrived who was fit to wield the weapon and the shield for their intended purpose.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

Pledging his body and spirit to the elements, he submerged himself in a pool of lava and was miraculously unharmed. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAccording to legend, the head of the Doomhammer was coaxed forth from the heart of Draenor itself.

It remained in the lava until an orc chieftain, clearing his mind of pride and dreams of glory, reached in and took the Doomhammer in his grasp.

This was a cowardly act!\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"I knelt beside him. \'My lord,\' was all I could manage to say.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"My mentor then told me that I must carry on, that he had led the Horde once but it was not his destiny to do so again.

					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Doomhammer, Part Nine</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nWhen a dying Orgrim Doomhammer bequeathed his armor and hammer to Thrall, the young orc felt that he was unworthy of such an honor. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nOrgrim told Thrall that there was no one breathing who was worthier.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe last words of Orgrim Doomhammer to Thrall were, "You will lead them... to victory... and you will lead them... to peace."\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nOrgrim expired in Thrall\'s arms. To show that the orcs were not without a leader, Thrall took on the old warrior\'s armor. Once the plate mail was secured, Thrall bent down and picked up the Doomhammer--passed on not from father to son, but from mentor to student. \r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

However, following his execution of the malign warchief Garrosh Hellscream, Thrall felt conflicted. This internal struggle was reflected in the Doomhammer as well. In Thrall\'s mind, the weapon that had embodied the ideals of justice and virtue had now come to represent vengeance.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nHistory repeated itself as the Doomhammer had once again become a "dead weight."

At its apex, one figure held sway over it all. Her name was Azshara. She was a leader of leaders, a queen of queens. Her power was absolute, and her thirst for knowledge and glory was unquenchable.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nOf the records that speak of Azshara, nearly all mention her bejeweled scepter called Sharas\'dal. The legends claim it granted the queen command over the world\'s seas, among other miraculous feats. So cherished was this scepter that Azshara rarely let it out of her sight. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIt was with her when she raised the night elf empire to new heights. And it was with her when she later brought the civilization crashing down in blood and fire.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Sharas\'dal, Scepter of Tides, Part Two</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAn excerpt from The Coronation of Queen Azshara:\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"For days the coronation ceremony went on. Each night, the Highborne nobility lavished precious gifts on Azshara to curry her favor, but there was one she cherished more than all the others. A night elf named Lord Xavius presented the queen with a jeweled scepter, etched with delicate magical sigils. He promised Azshara that so long as she kept it close, it would bring her prosperity and great power. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"Azshara held the scepter aloft, and the jewels shimmered in the light of the moons like brilliant stars. The sight of the queen and her gift was so beautiful that it brought many of the attendant Highborne to tears."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Sharas\'dal, Scepter of Tides, Part Three</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAt the heart of ancient Azeroth sat a massive lake of scintillating energy called the Well of Eternity. For decades, the night elves studied this fount of arcane magic, and they became learned sorcerers. Queen Azshara carried on this tradition, as did her loyal Highborne servitors. They devoted themselves to plumbing the Well of Eternity\'s depths in search of knowledge and power.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nPerhaps no one was more suited to this task than Azshara. She was one of the greatest magic users who had ever lived. As she honed her command over the lake\'s energies, she infused a drop of its living waters into her bejeweled scepter.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Sharas\'dal, Scepter of Tides, Part Four</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nQueen Azshara\'s enchanted scepter afforded her great power. Imbued with the Well of Eternity\'s potent waters, it held sway over the rivers and the seas, aquatic creatures of all kinds, and the life energies that stirred within Azshara herself. She granted it a new name, one befitting its remarkable properties: Sharas\'dal, Scepter of Tides.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nOne of the first things Azshara did with Sharas\'dal was use its power to enhance her legendary beauty. As the years wore on, the queen seemed to grow younger and more mesmerizing. A brilliant aura enveloped Azshara, enthralling those who looked upon her. The Highborne marveled at this strange phenomenon. A few even took it as a sign of divinity.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Sharas\'dal, Scepter of Tides, Part Five</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAn excerpt from Glory to the Queen Born of Stars:\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"Of the wonders our queen brought to this world, perhaps none was so great as Lathar\'Lazal. As masons constructed the temple, Azshara shaped the waters around it with the Scepter of Tides. She spoke the names of the rivers and the seas, and they moved at her command. Salt water from the roaring ocean and fresh water from the mountain streams trickled to Azshara\'s side. With the flick of her wrist, the queen partitioned them into great lakes that hugged Lathar\'Lazal\'s sturdy foundation.\r\n<BR/><BR/>"Creatures of all kinds populated these waters, and they were at Azshara\'s beck and call. Whenever she walked the bridges of Lathar\'Lazal, nearby schools of exotic fish would array themselves in colorful patterns. She even kept a colossal sea giant bound to one of the lakes. She used her scepter to make him perform tricks and feats of strength, much to the delight of the watching Highborne. Curious night elves from the far corners of the empire journeyed to Lathar\'Lazal to study the mythical creature and his habits."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Sharas\'dal, Scepter of Tides, Part Six</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAs the night elf empire stretched across the world, Azshara spent more and more time in her palace at the Well of Eternity\'s shores. She obsessed over the lake and used Sharas\'dal to manipulate its mysterious energies. Azshara dreamed of making the world into a paradise--her paradise. But it would only be possible if she and her Highborne servitors could harness the Well of Eternity\'s true potential.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nTheir reckless experiments eventually sent arcane magic crashing through the Twisting Nether, the realm of demons. In time, the Burning Legion learned of the Well of Eternity and the world of Azeroth.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Sharas\'dal, Scepter of Tides, Part Seven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAn excerpt from The War of the Ancients, by the historian Llore:\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"Azshara\'s obsession with remaking the world led her straight into the clutches of the Legion\'s ruler, Sargeras. The queen forged a pact with him for unfathomable power. All that Sargeras asked in return was for Azshara and her Highborne to summon his minions into Azeroth.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"It was a difficult request, even for such gifted sorcerers. Azshara and the Highborne approached the challenge with great fervor. Legends say the queen helped her servants open a gateway for the Legion\'s agents. She used Sharas\'dal to gather the Well of Eternity\'s energies and fuel the Highborne\'s spellwork. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"Through this portal, the first armor-clad demons spilled into Azeroth. Many more would follow. The Legion would march across the land, spreading fire and death, bringing war and cataclysm."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Sharas\'dal, Scepter of Tides, Part Eight</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe War of the Ancients ended in catastrophe. Azshara\'s hubris and abuse of power would lead to the destruction of the Well of Eternity. The enormous lake buckled in upon itself, eventually igniting a monstrous explosion that shattered the world\'s surface.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAzshara watched these events unfold from her broken palace. She refused to believe that her dreams of paradise were dead, that the world she had once cradled in her palms was coming apart beneath her feet. Many of the Highborne were just as delusional as the queen, and they remained at her side.\r\n<BR/><BR/>As the ocean roared in to fill the void left by the destroyed Well of Eternity, Azshara raised Sharas\'dal high. She wove a magical shield around herself and the Highborne, saving them from being crushed by the colossal waves. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut it was only a momentary reprieve. The howling ocean soon swallowed the queen, Sharas\'dal, and her followers. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThen it sucked them down and down into darkness.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Sharas\'dal, Scepter of Tides, Part Nine</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nFrom a fragmented text called The Song of Scales, author unknown:\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"They drifted into the abyss, but Azshara and her Highborne remained unbroken.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"The darkness around them was absolute, and so the queen willed Sharas\'dal to bring them light. It did.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"Azshara\'s and the Highborne\'s blood ran cold, and so the queen willed Sharas\'dal to warm them. It did.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"Their lungs burned for air, and so the queen willed Sharas\'dal to let them breathe the water... but it did not. The scepter could not save them. Oblivion spread its arms and beckoned the desperate Highborne.\r\n<BR/><BR/>"As the ocean crushed the life from their bodies, ancient creatures stirred in the darkness. Their whispers flowed through the currents. Their powers wrapped tight around the queen and her servants. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"The Highborne became something new. Something more. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"A fleece of scales shimmered over their skin. Tails thrashed against the currents. The unknown entities made the queen and her followers one with the sea... they made them into the naga."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Sharas\'dal, Scepter of Tides, Part Ten</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThough Azshara\'s old empire was in ruins, she crafted a new one far from the light of the sun. The queen and her naga servants created a capital, Nazjatar, at the bottom of the sea. With patience and cunning, they expanded their dominion over the oceans. It is even said that Azshara nurtured an alliance with the mysterious and powerful entities who had transformed them into naga.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAs the years wore on, Azshara relied on Sharas\'dal less and less. She still treasured the scepter, but she found it was more useful in the hands of her fearsome sea witches. These loyal servants wielded Sharas\'dal as a weapon to spread the naga\'s domain and crush all who opposed them.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Sharas\'dal, Scepter of Tides, Part Eleven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nIt was not long before the naga sea witches learned to harness Sharas\'dal as Azshara had. With a swipe of the scepter, they drove thousands of aquatic predators into a frenzy and unleashed them against troublesome sea giants. With a whispered incantation, they boiled Kvaldir raiders from the inside out and scattered their remains to the currents. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nWhen the sea witches were not wielding Sharas\'dal, Azshara would often carry it at her side and reminisce about times long past. She still remembered Lord Xavius\'s promise: so long as she kept the scepter close, it would bring her prosperity and great power. \r\n<BR/><BR/>The queen had lost much, but she was not dead. Far from it. In her heart, she knew that one day her empire under the sea would eclipse even that of the ancient night elves. One day, the world would be hers again, and she would not let it slip through her fingers a second time.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

					"My father called the stone the Dream of Argus, though I've come to understand it has been known by other names in the past. It was a crystal of great power, capable of sustaining an entire village on its energy alone. Some say that it was a gift passed on to our family by the naaru during the exodus from Argus - a connection that would explain its fabled power. \r\n\r\nSuch speculation is for naught, however, since the crystal has been broken for as long as I can remember. The Shards of the Dream, as I call them, appear as powerless as any of the latent crystals found in the deep mines of Shadowmoon. I continue to seek a means of rejoining them in hopes that one day the Dream of Argus can be reborn, and that the draenei people could use it to flourish on our home of Draenor.",
					"On a prospecting mission with some of the local Rangari, we happened upon a small enclave of Shadowmoon orcs, who were investigating the same mineral deposits. In idle discussion, the orcs spoke of rituals that they use to fuse smaller crystals together into large structures that can be stored with magical energy. I had never held previous interest in the Shadowmoon orcs' strange magics, but it seems it may hold the key to restoring the Dream of Argus.\r\n\r\nI must investigate this further.",
					"The prelate council has denied my request for an envoy to be sent to the Shadowmoon orcs. They believe such an investigation to be folly, and that I am simply desperate to restore a broken relic. They cannot force me to stay, however. \r\n\r\nOn the morrow I will strike out on my own, in hopes that the Shadowmoon will be willing to assist me in my efforts.",
					"I have travelled for days and have yet to come upon an orc of the Shadowmoon clan. Though there had been a noticeable lapse in trade with the orcs, we were unaware at how reclusive they had become recently. \r\n\r\nIt is clear that I must make the perilous trek up the western cliffs. I can see the massive stone monoliths carved with the runes of their clan looming above the plateaus. I must seek the Shadowmoon there.",
					"It appears that the Shadowmoon have withdrawn into their fortifications, though for what reason I am unsure. As I reached the top of the cliffs, I could see the members of their clan gathered in numbers I have never seen before in one place. \r\n\r\nThe orcs acted strange, however they were not unfriendly. They called this place the Pillars of Fate, and it appeared as if they were readying some great magical rituals. When questioning about the purpose of the rituals, or the recent reclusiveness of their clan, the orcs only offered cryptic responses.",
					"They did seem to be willing to discuss their methods of crystal reconstruction. An orc that was tending to some crystal structure of unknown purpose directed me to one called Lor Stonefist. She was a warrior of the Shadowmoon, as I understood it, and showed a particular affinity for the crystals native to the land.\r\n\r\nI was told she spent most of her time in the crystal cave to the north of the encampment. There she studied the native crystals for ways to improve their potential abilities. I will seek her there.",
					"Stonefist was a tall and imposing woman. Her brutish features belied her intelligence, and I was quite surprised at how knowledgeable she was when we discussed the restoration of the crystal. She boasted that with the help of the Shadowmoon's magics, she could recombine any crystal to be as flawless as it would have been in nature.  \r\n\r\nI would need to enlist the help of two other orcs in the camp in order to accomplish this: Vok Blacktongue and Koros Soulsplinter.",
					"Blacktongue, was a high ritualist of Shadowmoon, and a master runecarver. The ritual required a precise arrangement of runes, and due to the unique nature of my crystal we would require the work of an expert. She mentioned that the orc could normally found in one of the runemaster's huts in the southern part of the camp. They could be identified by the standing stones surrounding the structure, as well as the floating runestones above.\r\n\r\nThe other, Koros Soulsplinter, may be more difficult to locate. A reclusive hermit, Soulsplinter preferred to spend his time out of sight of the living. It is said, however, that he can often be seen among the graves upon the high hill, overlooking the camp below.  There he would commune with the dead ancestors, whom it is said he preferred over his living brethren.",
					"I have managed to locate the two orcs, and they have agreed to assist myself and Stonefist.  I will admit that their magic is strange to me, but I am mostly ignorant of these things. If their magic will help in restoring the Dream of Argus, then it is far from me to question it.\r\n\r\nWe located an empty cave on a terrace overlooking the Shadowmoon's great keep, Anguish Fortress, and under the instruction of Stonefist, I began constructing an altar. With the combined knowledge of draenei artificing and Shadowmoon mystic rune carving, we should be able to create a device capable of combining any crystal into its original form. \r\n\r\nThe Dream of Argus will be reborn!",
					"Construction continues on the altar device, however my allies appear to be growing restless. Some unknown force is stirring among the Shadowmoon, and they grow more hostile by the day. The orcs assisting me constantly argue in their language that I do not understand, and I fear they may not wish to help me much longer.\r\n\r\nI will continue to work, despite the growing tension. The fate of the draenei may very well rest on this crystal.",
					"The device is nearly complete, though I am growing concerned with my presence among the Shadowmoon. The clan seem to be mobilizing an army, and I can see their sorcerers conjuring foul beings from the forbidden realms. I am beginning to feel like a prisoner here among the pillars.\r\n\r\nI can only hope that the Shadowmoon will let me return to the draenei once my mission is complete.",
					"I have been betrayed. We had completed the device, but before I was able to activate it and restore the crystal, the orcs turned on me. Stonefist stuck the blow, which left me broken and useless at the foot of the device. I could only watch as each orc took a piece of the crystal for themselves before I was dragged away. \r\n\r\nI now sit chained to the base of a heavy runestone, awaiting my fate. My only wish now is to see my people again one last time.",

					"Chapter 1 - The Front Line\r\n\r\nDismantling the Stormpike army is very much like peeling an onion. To get to the core, you must start by removing the outermost layers.\r\n\r\nThe front lines, comprised mostly of Stormpike Mountaineers and Alliance Sentinels, are tied to the Captain's bunker. It is Captain Balinda Stonehearth who empowers these units and provides for reinforcements when the lines are under siege. Strike at the Captain and the front line forces will crumble.\r\n\r\n",
					"Chapter 2 - The Twin Towers\r\n\r\nMake no mistake; Vanndar Stormpike is a cunning foe and certainly no fool. Once the front line has been breached, the secondary defensive targets must still be destroyed. It is the twin towers of Stonehearth and Icewing which control the Stormpike Guardsmen outside of Dun Baldar and the Stormpike patrols.",
					"Beware, soldier, as both of these towers are heavily fortified and ruled over by one of Vanndar's elite Commanders. Should your forces breach the fortifications, make certain that the Commander within has been ... silenced. This too will be part of the dismantling of the Stormpike.\r\n",
					"Chapter 3 - The Four Commanders\r\n\r\nThe third layer of the Stormpike onion is comprised of the four Commanders. In this respect, Vanndar has mimicked our own glorious Frostwolf defenses. Of course he will tell you otherwise... But I digress. \r\n\r\nThe four Commanders control the ebb and flow of the Stormpike Guardsmen that fiercely guard Dun Baldar. Silence them all and the Stormpike Guardsmen will fall. \r\n\r\nThen there is but one layer left to peel.\r\n",
					"Chapter 4 - The Dun Baldar Bunkers\r\n\r\nAs you have undoubtedly noticed, the Stormpike defensive layers are in place to prevent one mighty power move from dismantling the entire army. Before you ask, yes, this is exactly how our own forces are setup and no, I will not change our defensive structure. They copied us, why should we have to change?\r\n",

Though he did not create the staff, he made it into the legendary weapon it is today.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAlodi never knew his real parents. From infancy, he was raised in an orphanage for magically gifted children in Dalaran. His only connection to his parents was Ebonchill, which they had left with the boy when they abandoned him at the school.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nHis dubious parentage and mixed ancestry made life difficult for Alodi. Most magi pitied him, but others treated him with scorn. No one believed he would rise to greatness.

					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Ebonchill, Part Two</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAlodi became Guardian at a dire time for the Council of Tirisfal. This secret order of magi was created to protect Azeroth from demons. For many years, its members succeeded in their quest.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThen a dreadlord named Kathra\'natir changed everything. The demon infiltrated Dalaran and thwarted the council\'s attempts to stop him. Kathra\'natir sowed unrest in the streets, threatening to engulf the city in turmoil.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nTo defeat Kathra\'natir, the Council of Tirisfal\'s magi took drastic measures. Through a complex ritual, they infused all of their power into Alodi. It was an act of great trust and faith.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nKathra\'natir was no match for the newly empowered Alodi.

This was due in part to the icy enchantments woven into Ebonchill. With the staff, Alodi learned how to freeze water and manipulate air temperature, often to the chagrin of the orphanage headmaster.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nShortly after Alodi became Guardian, he honed his mastery of frost magic and imbued Ebonchill with his own powers. A wintry aura enveloped the staff. Much to the astonishment of Alodi\'s companions on the Council of Tirisfal, the weapon never felt cold to the touch. Ebonchill contained only a sliver of Alodi\'s might, but even that was more than most magi could ever hope of wielding.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

Many records tell of him calling down vicious ice storms to overwhelm his enemies, or encasing the Legion\'s agents in solid blocks of ice before exiling them from the world.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nNear the end of Alodi\'s one hundred years of service as Guardian, he turned his attention to his apprentices. He had trained and tutored many young magi in the ways of the arcane. They had become the family that he had never had, and he treated them all as his own sons and daughters.\r\n<BR/><BR/>Alodi decided to pass on Ebonchill to one of these learned apprentices. He did not choose the most powerful. More important to Alodi were compassion, wisdom, and comradery. After much consideration, he entrusted his greatstaff to the apprentice who most embodied these traits.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSo began a tradition of bequeathing Ebonchill that would endure for millennia.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

At the end of her one hundred years of service, she refused to step down as Guardian.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAegwynn\'s disobedience eventually forced the council\'s hand. It formed the Tirisgarde, a group of talented magi charged with hunting down and subduing the wayward Guardian. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAmong the Tirisgarde was a promising but arrogant young spellcaster named Tarthen. His aging master had long ago inherited Ebonchill, and he was in the process of choosing which apprentice would take it up next.\r\n<BR/><BR/>Tarthen fully expected to receive the greatstaff. He eclipsed his fellow apprentices in raw power and potential. But Tarthen\'s master put little weight in such things. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nWhen the day of the ceremony came, the elderly mage gave Ebonchill to another apprentice--one who embodied the qualities of compassion, wisdom, and comradery.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

In secret, he practiced with the greatstaff and learned to wield its extraordinary energies. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nOnly a handful of Tarthen\'s most trusted Tirisgarde allies knew of his theft. They alone witnessed him bending Ebonchill\'s magics to his will, and they were in awe of the power at his fingertips. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nOnce he was confident he had mastered Ebonchill, Tarthen set out to do what no other Tirisgarde had thus far managed--he would defeat Aegwynn and forever etch his name in the histories.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

Many of these magi used Ebonchill to protect Azeroth from demons, but not the human named Arrexis.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nArrexis was a lover of knowledge. For days on end, he would lock himself in his personal archives, poring over ancient tomes and scrolls. When Ebonchill passed to him, he decided to study the greatstaff rather than wield it in battle. Arrexis knew well the weapon\'s history and deadly potential. \r\n<BR/><BR/>From his examinations, Arrexis believed that he could employ Ebonchill as a catalyst to power great spells--feats of magic that normally only a Guardian would be capable of.

Sargeras, leader of the Burning Legion, had possessed the Guardian.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nDue to Sargeras\'s manipulation, Medivh forged a pact with the orcish Horde and began paving the way for its invasion of Azeroth. To prevent the Council of Tirisfal from meddling in his affairs, the darkened Guardian secretly assassinated some of its members.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nMedivh\'s gaze soon fell upon Arrexis and Ebonchill.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

The structure was built atop a nexus of potent ley lines. The energies that coursed through Karazhan sometimes warped reality in the region.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nArrexis and his followers experimented with their warding magics outside Karazhan, attempting to neutralize the tower\'s strange powers. The records indicate that Guardian Medivh visited the magi at this time and offered his advice.

Some rumors claim that the Guardian altered Ebonchill so that it would disrupt Arrexis\'s warding spells and destroy the venerated mage. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nWhatever the truth, it is known that Arrexis heeded Medivh\'s advice. The elderly mage and his followers conducted a great ritual to protect an area from demonic incursions. The spell was only meant to be a test, but it had disastrous consequences.\r\n<BR/><BR/>When the magi began their casting, they inadvertently opened a path between Azeroth and the realm of demons, the Twisting Nether. Arrexis and all of his followers were ripped through the gateway and were never seen again. One account states that within the Twisting Nether, a handful of demons fell upon the shocked magi and slaughtered them to the last.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe demons were led by an eredar known as Balaadur. He took Ebonchill as a trophy of his bloody victory, and the ancient tradition of passing the greatstaff from master to apprentice died alongside Arrexis and his doomed protege.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

Turns out the spirit of Gutrek was trapped up in his weapon, which they kept on display at the arena. At the recommendation of the shaman, the ogres took the weapon to some secret place, broke it down into pieces, and scattered the pieces throughout Nagrand."',

I didn\'t have it for long, but I was able to jot down some notes about the location of the pieces of his weapon:\r\n\r\n"The pommel was brought to the Broken Precipice, where it was to be housed in the skull of Gutrek\'s first kill. It looks like it was some manner of large beast that he fought in the big bone pit."',
					'"The hilt was to be buried in the marshlands, among the serpents whose poison claimed Gutrek\'s life. There\'s something there about covering it with a spiral stone, which is supposed to keep the spirit at bay somehow.\r\n\r\n"The final piece, Gutrek\'s blade, was to be displayed in a place of honor for all time overlooking the Ring of Blood. I don\'t think I\'ve seen it there myself, but it says it\'s supposed to be somewhere where it has a clear view of every battle.\r\n\r\n"Still no mention of how it was dismantled or how it can be remade, though..."',

Otherwise, why wouldn\'t they just break it down like any other weapon? \r\n\r\n"Unfortunately, nobody\'s quite sure where this place is, only that it\'s called the Spirit Forge and that it was overrun by gronn some time ago.

The most generalized abjuration spell is the mana shield, a spell that transmutes raw mana into a barrier that protects the caster from attacks. Properly executed, this spell can protect the mage against even the most formidable of attacks - but the mana shield is very difficult for a novice to master. It often takes a mage months of practice to even conjure a simple mana shield, and thus, more basic alternatives exist.\r\n",
					"A series of elemental armor spells were invented to aid the traveling mage in the unfortunate case that he or she might be attacked. These spells require far less raw energy to cast than a mana shield and are more easily maintained over time, but lack the raw potency of the mana shield. Rather than stopping an attack completely, a frost armor spell might simply decrease the effectiveness of the assault. The more advanced armor spells grant other benefits - for example, the potent mage armor spell actually assists the caster in regaining magical power more easily.",
					"Practitioners of the arcane arts are often ambitious, and we frequently find ourselves in situations where magic may slip just slightly beyond our control. It is for this reason that the 'Ward' spells exist. Ward spells are quick, potent incantations to protect the caster against a form of elemental damage - damage which is often caused by the caster attempting one of the other schools of magic. This is why studying abjuration early is so imperative.",
					"One of the most renowned practitioners of Abjuration magic is Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider. While the prince is quite formidable in all schools of magic, Kael'thas has created a variation of Mana Shield that is practically unsurpassed in among the residents of Dalaran. Also notable is the Arcanist Doan, who has perfected a spell that combines Evocation and Abjuration to shield himself for a short time while preparing a powerful area-of-effect spell.

Orcs tend to make poor arcanists, but culturally have a heritage of peaceful shamanism, combined with a more recent focus on the darker magic of warlocks and necromancy.\r\n\r\nTauren - Few experiment with the arcane, but the bull-men are highly attuned to the magics of the earth.  As is the case with many nature-worshipping tribes, many follow the path of the shaman.  Furthermore, their most senior druids can rival the archdruids of Darnassus in power.\r\n",
					"Troll - A surprising affinity for the magic arts belies the trolls' barbaric reputation and history.  My Zul'tour - an expedition into the troll empires of Zul'Aman, Zul'Farrak, and Zul'Drak - has revealed a startling variety in troll casters, ranging from witch doctors to shadow priests to a bizarre animal worship that most closely resembles druidism.\r\n\r\nUndead - The undead have as much magical skill as can be expected of any living human... if not more.  Sylvanas' Forsaken, in particular, fling spells with the frightening levels of zeal.",
					'Blood Elf - A history of prolonged exposure to magical energy has left an indelible mark on the Blood Elves.  These lithe, magic-addicted creatures seem to fare well in any magical school they study.  Most recently, the blood elves have taken up the path of the "Blood Knight", which can be loosely described as a form of paladinism.\r\n\r\nTaunka - Much like their tauren cousins, taunka tend to focus on magic stemming from the earth.\r\n',
					"The Old Wizard's Almanac: Other Arcanist-Friendly Races\r\n\r\nMagic is not limited simply to the races of the Horde and the Alliance.  Many of the creatures that make Azeroth their home are capable of thaumaturgical pursuits. - O.W.\r\n",
					"Naga - While males are more suited for melee combat, female naga are incredible sorcerers, commanding the power of water and ice at their fingertips.  It should be noted that their ancient queen Azshara was reputedly one of the most powerful magic-users in Azeroth's history.\r\n\r\nNerubian - Only the most powerful Nerubian leaders have the capacity for magic.  However, following the onslaught of the Scourge, many plagued Nerubians have become necromancers.\r\n",
					"Ogre - Most of these expatriates from Draenor focus on the path of the warrior or the ranger, but a small percentage choose a life of sorcery as ogre-magi.  Cho'gall, one of the first ogre-magi, was an immensely powerful sorcerer (in addition to simply being immense).\r\n\r\nSatyr - These dangerous creatures have features similar to those of night elves, but twisted demonic bodies. Masters of demonic magic, satyrs are incredibly dangerous. Extreme caution is advised when approaching them.",
					"Blue Dragons - The ancient children of Malygos are among the foremost experts on arcane magic. Some, such as the adventurous Kalecgos, are friendly to the mortal wizard and potentially could make excellent research partners. Unfortunately, recent rumors from the north indicate that some blue dragons have grown extremely hostile to other spellcasters. The reasons for this aggression are as-yet unknown.\r\n",
					"The Old Wizard's Almanac: The Shamanic Races\r\n\r\nMy travels have introduced me to numerous societies across Azeroth, many of whom practice shamanism.  Many of these peoples live off the land, shunning advanced society for a more nature-centric existence. - O.W.\r\n",
					"Quilboar - The few quilboar that remain in Kalimdor are known to practice geomancy, a crude form of shamanism.  Some plagued quilboar practice this form of magic even in undeath.\r\n\r\nGnoll - Gnolls are a strange race.  I once managed to gain the favor of a clan leader in Redridge by performing a basic cantrip - the kind taught to Dalaran's schoolchildren.  For a day, he was my best friend, until he forgot my trick and sicced his hunters on me.  Anyhow, when they can be bothered to pay attention long enough, gnolls tend to focus on elemental shamanism.\r\n",
					"Centaur - Centaur females tend to use a dark, perverted form of shamanism.  Magic use among centaur males, on the other hand, is quite rare.\r\n\r\nWolvar - This wolverine-like group may appear primitive upon first glance.  However, their tribal leaders are often very powerful shaman.\r\n",
					"Oracles - Though they are the sworn enemies of the wolvar, the oracles seem to have a nearly identical social system.  Grunt work is done by warriors, but their cultural leaders are nearly always great shamanic practitioners.\r\n\r\nFurbolg - These days, it seems few furbolg ever become shaman.  Shamanism is much more common among the free-willed furbolg tribes.  Furthermore, some free-willed furbolg are even capable of basic shapeshifting, much like a trained druid.\r\n",
					"The Old Wizard's Almanac: Peoples of the Land\r\n\r\nShamanism isn't the only nature-centric magic.  Many of Azeroth's simpler races perform spells that stem from the the earth's energies, but which cannot be called shamanism.  Whether their magic powers come from the same source as the shaman's magic or not is a constant point of debate in the halls of the Violet Citadel. - O.W.",
					"Tuskarr - The walrus-men practice a form of magic that, on its surface, is astonishingly similar to shamanism.  Our scholars have not yet deciphered the source of the tuskarr's magic.\r\n\r\nKobold - These simple creatures are only capable of simple earth magic.  My exploits as a youth taught me that a few of them have perfected a rather nasty fireball, but that's about it.\r\n",
					"Wildkin - These feathered creatures go by many names - moonkin, owlbear, and owlkin, to name a few.  These gentle giants possess a natural, druidic energy similar to that of the night elves.\r\n\r\nHarpy - The cackling bird-women are capable of powerful elemental storm magic.  Little is known about the source of their power, as 1) they attack invaders on sight, 2) few can discern any meaning behind their shrill cries, and 3) none can tolerate the smell of their nests.\r\n",
					"Murloc - For many years these enigmatic creatures appeared to be capable of only the most basic magic.  Do not be deceived by their unintelligent fae.  The fish-men are fully capable of casting potent earth and water spells, and their numbers on land increase by the day.\r\n\r\nMakrura - The lobster-like race of makrura, while widely considered to be primitive, has an innate capacity for water magic.\r\n",
					"The Old Wizard's Almanac: Non-Magical Creatures\r\n\r\nMagic isn't for everyone.  The non-intelligent beasts of the world have survived for millennia on their wits alone, as have several of the simpler races.  Some races, while socially advanced, simply prefer to avoid magic in favor of other pursuits.  As Kirin Tor, it is critically important that we understand the way that these races thrive without any magic at all. - O.W.\r\n",
					"Goblin - Goblins tend to be distrustful of magic, preferring to focus mainly on technological ventures.  Unlike their gnomish counterparts, they lack the capacity to understand and appreciate the arcane.  That being said, there are some that have combined their technology with magic, yielding interesting results.\r\n\r\nTrogg - These primitive creatures simply lack the intelligence necessary for magic.\r\n",
					'Magnataur - The enormous magnataur have little to no magical affinity.  Magnataur casters are very rare, and tend to be follow a shamanic route if they practice magic at all.  I can tell you first-hand, however, that they won\'t go down without a fight, and their thick hides can withstand several of the most powerful frostbolts.\r\n\r\nVrykul - While Northrend\'s half-giants naturally know little to no magic, some have been trained in necromancy by the Lich King. I have also heard rumors of "rune magic" of some kind, but I have not yet had the opportunity to research this intriguing subject in depth.',

Using his unparalleled skills of defensive magic, Antonidas set up a magical field that would destroy any undead that touched it (an earlier version of the defensive fields used today).",
					"Sadly, this was not enough, and Arthas found a way to dispel the enchantment.  He marched straight into Dalaran and murdered Antonidas in cold blood.  Kel'Thuzad and Arthas entered the Violet Citadel, took the Book of Medivh, and summoned Archimonde.  \r\n\r\nAs the undead army left the city in search of new targets, Archimonde demolished its structures, bringing its magical spires crashing to the ground.  Antonidas' Dalaran, now leaderless and in shambles, was no more.",

His attempts at arcane intellect made the subjects stupider. Without any doubt, his tutors agreed that their pupil, Bungledorf, was the worst mage in Dalaran.",
					"Bungledorf had come to learn with great hopes. He guzzled mana potions before class, mistakenly believing they would increase his skill. But all they ever increased was the number of times he accidentally burped during important invocations, often setting classmates' robes ablaze or turning his teacher's beard into sheep's wool in the process.",
					"At his first exam, Bungledorf was asked to cast frost armor correctly. The other students shifted in their seats fearfully as he began the incantation. A blue fog encompassed the young lad and for a moment it looked as though he had succeeded. But then he began to shiver and sneeze violently, and everyone finally realized: he had given himself frostbite.",
					'One day Bungledorf was in the park, wondering whether he was cut out to be a mage. He saw some children playing nearby and remembered his dream of being a powerful spellcaster. "Yes," he thought, "I can do it; I just need to try harder!" He looked for something to practice on and noticed an unusual tree before him. Summoning his courage, Bungledorf began casting a spell on it. He shut his eyes, afraid to see the result...',
					'When he finally looked, the tree was replaced with a beautiful night elf. "It worked!" he cried, "It\'s transformed! I am a mage after all!"\r\n\r\nThe night elf was confused for a moment and then smiled at him gently. "I am a druid, young one. We take other forms by our own will."',
					"Bungledorf blushed and stepped away, only to trip over his robes and fall headfirst into the lawn. A chorus of giggles greeted him as he adjusted his long pointed cap and shuffled off toward the dormitory, his head hanging low.",
					"The night elf lingered, pondering the boy. When she turned to leave, she caught her foot in something, and nearly lost her balance. Surprised at the unfamiliar obstacle, she looked down to see a glistening crop of mageroyal, its petals slowly unfurling into full bloom, where moments ago there had been nothing. She wondered at this, and then, realizing, turned back in the direction Bungledorf had been walking, but the young mage was already gone.",

Illusion can be used for disguise or manipulation, but beware, spells to counteract illusions exist in the divination school. It is not viable to base your entire career on illusionary magic.",
					"Contrary to popular belief, illusions are far more than mere parlor tricks. The spell of invisibility is among the most integral in a battle mage's repertoire, as you will often find yourself in dangerous situations and in need of a quick method for a strategic retreat. Illusions can also be used to deceive your opponents into thinking that you are elsewhere, or even trick your enemies into fighting each other. This is no easy task, but the accomplished illusionist can turn allies into enemies - and his or her own enemies into allies.",

In life, she developed a spell that displayed several images of her body that were nearly indistinguishable from her real form.

A few daring wizards have occasionally attempted to summon water without remembering the glass - and thus, the art of summoning water elementals was born. Water elementals are a wizard's best friend.

Portals, when used properly, are just as safe and certainly faster. HOWEVER, in practice portals have a history of being a burden on any society in which it is offered to the general public. Of all the major spells developed and maintained by the Kirin Tor (including polymorph), portal technology is the closest to becoming banished from anything but emergency usage.",
					"Why all the trouble? First, Ley Lines don't grow on trees. Massive traffic through a Line from all over Azeroth wears down the infrastructure and must be periodically replaced. We charge the mage for every portal via reagent taxes, and encourage mages to pass off these charges to those using the portal. But these taxes don't even begin to cover the time cost of replacing a Line, only the materials. \r\n",
					'Remember that a portal most used is a portal most efficient: More persons using a single portal causes no further stress to the Ley Lines, and is encouraged. A "Portalpooling" program is in the works that will give tax breaks to mages who create portals for no less than (5) persons. Read your latest issue of "Kirin Tor Monthly" to see the progress of the Portalpooling program. \r\n',
					"Second, while a properly used portal is just as safe as your average zeppelin trip (maybe more so considering the engineering practices of goblins), an improperly used portal can potentially yield dire results. Here is a list of immutable regulations for appropriate portal usage:\r\n",
					"Rule #1: Do not create a portal to anywhere but the designated Kirin Tor portal drop-off zones. The most dangerous aspect of the portal spell is its vast potential. We realize it's easy for a mage to create a door to anywhere, so our only way to combat such potentially deadly acts is to make it punishable by death. \r\nSpecial Issue License D-6 permits open portal usage, but is rarely issued. Speak with your local Portal Trainer about qualifying for this license. \r\n",
					"Rule #2: Create a portal in the proper place, and use it in the proper way. Do not create a portal beneath the feet of someone. Do not linger halfway in and out of a portal. The portal is not a garbage disposal. The portal is not a shield. Do not use a portal like an umbrella, or any kind of shelter from the elements. \r\n",
					'Do not back out of a portal after partially entering it. Do not try and "grab" the edges of the portal, either from the inside or the outside. A portal does not create "handlebars" to assist usage, and disruption of its boundaries is dangerous. \r\n',
					"Rule #3: Never force or trick anyone to go through a portal. Not only is this is a great way to lose repeat customers, it's also incredibly dangerous (See Rule #2). \r\n",
					'Rule #4: Do not have someone who is polymorphed enter a portal. This has yet to not cause an explosion. This is also covered in "Polymorphic Rules & Regulations."\r\n',
					'Rule #5: Do not remove the liquid filter from a portal spell. Portals innately prevent large amounts of flowing water through them so that they can be cast underwater. To allow for water elementals to use a portal, this filter can be omitted when casting. Do not omit this when underwater! We feel obligated to mention Moderately Severe Claims Disaster Case 34-zz: "The Great Lakeshire Drought & The Great Ironforge Flood of 24 A.D."\r\n',
					"Rule #6: Standard Portal dimensions are 3 yards, 1 foot, 3 and 3/4 inches tall, 2 yards, 8 feet, 9 and 15/16 inches wide. Double-wide portal creation requires Special Issue License G-16, and is commonly issued to mages with a clean portal record of 8 years or more.

Because of the stories related to use of the Stone of the Tides, I have conjectured that it is',

He came upon a mysterious blue stone within which milky white strands floated and flowed. Intrigued by the stone, the warrior took it with him and continued upon his journey.\r\n\r\nOver the weeks and months, the warrior discovered that the stone had given him control over water.

But as the years went on, the Tidebearer became more reclusive, tending to stay for long periods of time away from court.\r\n\r\nThe Tidebearer was hiding a secret from the prying eyes of court. The abilities granted to him by the Stone of the Tides also came with a curse. As the years",

So the process continued for generations, the Stone appearing with the tide, and the Tidebearer leaving into the tide.\r\n\r\n\r\nModern day accounts of the Stone of the Tides have appeared from place to place, but one must still wonder why an object of such power would appear with such regularity, and by whose design.",

Furthermore, comprehensive research on these volatile schools shows a trend of decreasing academic prerequisites yielding increasingly powerful outcomes. \r\n",

I refuse to believe that that their efficiency so soundly trumps the common criticisms of being unstable or "evil" that these schools hold the monopoly of avenues for magical progress.

I've canceled most of my classes to focus on research of this terrible anomaly. \r\nWith immense precaution I've procured a shipment of the infested grain. Immediately I was both impressed and suspicious with how innocuous the whole package presented itself. There was no discoloration, no discernable odor, and no variation at all from any other sheaf of grain. \r\nAt that moment it was no longer a mystery how this plague spread so quickly. \r\n",

Symptoms ranged from fatigue, nausea, fever, to minor hallucinations, but rarely resulted in death. On human tissue, however, the plague acts uniformly and with unprecedented expediency towards necrosis.\r\n",

While it's certainly possible that these two occurrences are unrelated, I've decided to delegate more resources towards finding the source of this plague, for I fear there are intelligent hands pushing it upon our kin. \r\n\r\nMore research must be done here at Dalaran, however. I will decide who to send to investigate in my stead at a later date, after some heavy deliberation. ",
					"Oct 18.\r\n\r\nI've stumbled upon a key factor of this plague, one so cleverly hidden in its methodology that I've come to two immutable conclusions: That its development was for the singular purpose of ending human life, and its inception was at the hands of an intelligent being. \r\nLong term affliction of the plague causes a certain reanimation of activity in the dead. This activity is very small at first, and I disregarded it as a minor side-effect. However, this energy remained persistent and unwavering. A thought struck me, one which was both surprising and strong: The corpse was waiting for something. \r\n",

					'Day 1\n\n\r\n"A druid\'s gift is his freedom to embrace and explore all facets of nature."\n\n\r\nMalfurion so often spoke these words, I was once foolish enough to believe that he truly lived by them. Yet while my shan\'do spouted this freedom, he disgraced me and my fellow druids of the pack by banning our form. I can still recall with great clarity his angry tirades whenever he discovered us practicing in secret.\n\n\r\n"The pack form cannot be controlled. It will consume you, and endanger us all."\n\n\r\nThe ignorance with which Malfurion passed judgment on us is infuriating. Does he not realize that the spirit of the wolf ancient, Goldrinn, is by nature\'s grace within me and my pack brethren? We did not choose it. It chose us. To shun it would be to turn our backs on nature itself.',
					"It only pains me that at a time like this, when our race is threatened by war with the vile satyr, Malfurion rejects us -- the very druids who could turn the tide of battle in his favor.\n\n\r\nIt matters little now. Today my brethren and I will depart from night elf society forever to begin life anew in the wild. We will show our shan'do's beliefs to be wrong and prove that Goldrinn's spirit can in fact be controlled.\r\n",
					"Day 7\n\n\r\nSix nights have come and gone since we carved out our new homes in the heart of the forest. Our pack leader, Renthel, has taken charge over the community, and under his wise leadership I have at last found true freedom.\n\n\r\nEach night we practice our form at the roots of a fallen tree where we have placed Goldrinn's fang. A thing of beauty it is... merely being in its presence seems to empower me. At times I wonder if the wolf ancient left this remnant of himself on the world as a gift to those who pursue his form.\n\n\r\nThese nightly sessions have filled me with renewed confidence in my ability to harness Goldrinn's spirit. Although Malfurion so often spoke of its dangers, even now we are proving him to be wrong.\r\n",
					"Day 12\n\n\r\nThere was an argument tonight. A seasoned druid named Thaldrus laid claim to leadership of the pack over Renthel, and both druids settled the dispute in pack form. They circled one another for what seemed an eternity, mouths foaming and fangs bared, until Thaldrus lunged at Renthel and pinned him to the ground.\n\n\r\nRenthel honorably accepted his defeat and relinquished his leadership with no further violence. If only Malfurion could have witnessed the dignity with which Thaldrus and Renthel acted on this eve.\r\n",
					"Day 23\n\n\r\nSomething strange has been happening of late. My brothers spend more and more time in pack form throughout the day. Many of them claim that it is a necessity to mastering the form, yet I feel that is not the sole reason.\n\n\r\nAn urge, primal in origin, grows inside of me. It is a desire that I can only sufficiently sate when I take on the pack form. I fear that the others feel it too.\r\n",
					"Day 28\n\n\r\nTonight, under the two moons, we ventured through the wild in pack form and felled three stags. So famished were my brethren and I that we simply ripped into the creatures, clawing and biting at each other while we feasted. Euphoria washed over me as I sank my teeth into the stag's raw flesh. Even if I had been without an appetite, gorging on the creature would have satisfied me.\r\n\r\n",
					"Day 38\n\n\r\nFirst time out of pack form in seven nights. Live as a wolf like others, from one night to next. Pack leader Thaldrus says night elf bodies are weak. All trust him. All follow him. If he saw me now, he would kill me.\n\n\r\nGoldrinn's spirit consuming us. Fighting it feels just as wrong as giving in.\r\n",
					"Day 42\n\n\r\nStill taste pack leader Thaldrus' blood in my mouth. \n\n\r\nCannot recall details. Only remember Thaldrus taking Goldrinn's fang from fallen tree. Caught him dragging it into his den and--\n\n\r\n<This part of the page is illegible due to blood stains>\n\n\r\nTook two nights for Thaldrus to come out. We were waiting. Fangs and claws and rage. Tore him apart. Fur and flesh everywhere. Only gnawed bones afterward.\n\n\r\nNo leader now.\r\n",
					"Day 52\n\n\r\nMuch has come to pass of late, and I feel that at last I have regained a portion of my sanity. Five nights ago, I left my den to discover that the other pack members were gathered around something, or as I soon discovered, someone. A night elf whose scent I recognized as Ralaar Fangfire, a druid of Malfurion's ilk.\n\n\r\nAs one we encircled him, yet the intruder held his ground. I smelled not a hint of fear on him, despite the fact that he remained in night elf form. His arrogance was quite infuriating.\n\n\r\nThree of my enraged brothers charged Ralaar, and the newcomer took on the pack form and bested the challengers with little effort... yet he did not kill them.\r\nIn that instant I became aware of a difference between him and us. We had become savages... scarred, lean, and disheveled. Ralaar, however, was powerful, majestic, and still rife with Goldrinn's essence.\r\n",
					"When no others dared challenge him, Ralaar took on his night elf form and spoke. In a tirade that reminded me of Malfurion, he berated us for becoming mindless animals and squandering what he referred to as the purity of Goldrinn's essence. Yet unlike my former shan'do, Ralaar also promised to teach us the true path to harnessing the wolf ancient's spirit. I sensed tremendous rage in his voice, tempered by a self control that I had somehow lost in recent weeks.\n\n\r\nOne by one we all left our pack forms. I can only guess that my brethren, like I, felt a strange affinity to this newcomer, as if he were a messenger of Goldrinn himself. \n\n\r\nRalaar has since begun teaching us as he had promised, though he no longer answers to his given name.\n\n\r\nRather, he now refers to himself simply as Alpha Prime.\r\n-Gaedrin Moonfang, Druid of the Pack\r\n",

She and her brother were trying to protect a pair of dragonkin from a great Djaradin champion.\r\n\r\nThey appeared to be quite outmatched, but Nolaki was deeply committed to protecting her brother - a strong warrior in his own right - with no thought for her own safety, and no fear.\r\n\r\nI knew she belonged in the Tyr's Guard as the Exemplar of Sacrifice. Though if Koranos and I hadn't come along at just that time, that likely would have been her last heroic act.",
					"Exemplar of Order: Talthis\r\n\r\nTalthis is simply unusual in how he values order. Koranos and I found him at the Flashfrost Assault, where the primalists attacked the Ruby Life Pools.\r\n\r\nHe was surrounded by heaps of stone and gravel from defeated elementals. More kept coming, and he kept fighting them, tirelessly. All the while, shouting about how disorder would not carry the day.\r\n\r\nKoranos and I joined him, and when the dust - and gravel - settled, I told him how the Tyr's Guard needed an Exemplar of Order in service to Tyr. He joined us without hesitation.",
					"Exemplar of Compassion: Valunei\r\n\r\nI saw Valunei when we were on our way from Valdrakken to Tyrhold. She had stopped to help an injured drakonid, who said he was a veteran of the rebellion against the Aspects. Contemptible!\r\n\r\nBut not only did Valunei heal him, as we were walking up, I saw her hand him a pouch of gold. She refused to tell me how much was in it. But she helped that drakonid - who had been injured fighting against good and order - without stopping just at his physical injuries.\r\n\r\nSeeing that, I knew she was the right paladin to serve as Tyr's Exemplar of Compassion.",
					"Exemplar of Justice: Hadwin\r\n\r\nWe met Hadwin in the Ohn'ahran Plains, as we heard loud noises off the main road. Following the sound, we came upon Hadwin and a centaur - Bolor, I think, her name was - fighting gorlocs.\r\n\r\nThe gorlocs had killed her hound companion, and Hadwin, having heard her story, accompanied her to bring justice to the gorlocs. Bolor had wanted to kill every gorloc in the camp, but Hadwin insisted, they would only fight the gorloc chieftain, and those gorlocs which stood in their way.\r\n\r\nSeeing his commitment to make things right, and his aversion to vengeance, I knew he would be our Exemplar of Justice.",

Such was not to be his fate, however. Whereas Malfurion excelled at wielding nature magic, Illidan failed.\r\n\r\nThe bitterness stemmed from Illidan's love for Tyrande Whisperwind.

The old elf was stubborn, unimaginative, and timid. His ineffective tactics wasted the sorcerers' talents.

Not to stir discontent, or to claim my theories are immutable truths, but to encourage others to ponder these subjects for themselves.",
					'It has been said that the Dream was created by Keeper Freya, acting on behalf of her patron, Eonar. And yet, I have noticed that the titans\' acolytes do not speak of something as "finished" until it has been ordered. \r\n\r\nSo did they truly create the Dream, or merely discover it, seeing its vibrancy as chaos to which they were compelled to bring structure?',
					"Seeking an answer, I have spoken to many spirits who inhabit the Dream. Dryads, ancients, grove keepers, and others. None of them tell of a titan creating the Dream.\r\n\r\nInstead, they speak of the first spirits awakening long ago within its wilds, in lands as beautiful and free as they are today.\r\n\r\n(Though I wonder, since time has so little meaning here, whether those born of the Dream truly think in terms of past or present.)",
					"We have also been told that the Dream is a sort of framework for life on Azeroth. And it is true that we can see reflections of our world within the Dream.\r\n\r\nYet while it is clear these realms share a bond, is one a copy of the other? Or might both be reflections, each informing the shape of its counterpart?",
					"Many times I have shrugged off the call of sleep and taken wing to explore the distant reaches of the Dream. The farther I flew, the greater the wonders I beheld.\r\n\r\nLife took forms strange and unfamiliar. Bizarre, impossible plants and trees. Creatures unlike any I beheld before.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Dream is bound not only to Azeroth, but to realms not yet discovered. Is it a reflection of those places, too?",
					"At these far reaches, I felt the presence of entities whose power seemed vast and unknowable, akin to the titans themselves.\r\n\r\nHad I reached the edges of the Dream where it flows into the Realms of Life? Are they one and the same? Truly, I cannot say, for as waves of joy and contentment washed over me, I could no longer resist the call of sleep.\r\n\r\nI awoke back at the Eye of Ysera, wondering if I had experienced a dream within the Dream.",
					"It seems clear that the servants of the titans wish the Dream to stay unchanging--at least, unchanged by any hand but theirs.\r\n\r\nYet the very nature of life is one of change, is it not? Things are born, live, and die, but life itself goes on.\r\n\r\nPerhaps life was never meant to be ordered. To be static and unchanging.",
					"The titans' servants do not seem to understand that Life and Death are sisters, bound together in a Great Cycle.\r\n\r\nDo they not wish to see this truth? Or is it beyond their fundamental nature to perceive it?\r\n\r\nIf we dragons see it, then it can only mean that we are touched not just by Life and Order, but other forces as well.",
					"And if dragons are the product of powers great and small being eternally intertwined, then so must all mortals be.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Azeroth herself was touched by all these forces. Or could she be their true source?\r\n\r\nSome things are beyond knowing. Some things are meant only to be pondered... in dreams.",

					"Our first day went as well as one can expect first days to go.  Most of our time was preoccupied with making the necessary arrangements to establish a base camp.  I located an ideal setting by a freshwater river inlet.  Judging by the old, abandoned docks nearby, this site was inhabited sometime ago.  As for the original inhabitants, only time can tell that tale.",
					"For this expedition I have assembled Ajeck Rouack and Sir S. J Erlgadin, along with my trusted servant, Barnil Stonepot.  I fought alongside Ajeck's father's side in many battles in defense of the Alliance.  Seeing her grown is quite special.  Her father schooled her well in the ways of weaponry.  Her skills with a bow make me wonder if there is elven blood running through those veins.",
					"Sir S. J. Erlgadin comes from human aristocracy.  His father, Count Erlgadin, was renowned for his generosity.  It was the Count who lobbied for improved working conditions for the Stonemasons' Guild during the restoration of Stormwind after the Second Great War.",
					"In the years that followed, after Stormwind betrayed the Stonemasons' Guild, Sir Erlgadin grew bitter about the role of the nobles within the Kingdom.  He no longer wished to uphold the position that his father's bloodline had earned for him in the House of Nobles.\r\n\r\nBut I digress.  The purpose of this story is not to act as a political treatise or a biography.  This is the account of my experiences hunting big game in the green hills of Stranglethorn....",
					"We rose with the sun.  Barnil began to prepare the morning meal. I noticed Ajeck's attention was somewhat distracted.  The day's trek would be long and our hunt would bring us close to danger.  A lack of focus could easily lead to an errant mishap.  Yet Ajeck seemed unable to divert her gaze from Barnil who stood by the edge of the river rinsing out his mess kit.",
					"Just as I was about to question Ajeck's lack of interest in the day's hunting strategy, she reached for her quiver, drew an arrow and unleashed a shot right towards poor Barnil.  But it was not Barnil that Ajeck was shooting at.  For when Barnil stepped aside, mouth agape, a large river crocilisk floated to the surface with Ajeck's arrow perfectly placed between his two large eyes.",
					"We set out toward the west, through the thick overgrowth of the tangled jungle.  Moving with slow, deliberate steps we paced through thick foliage in search of prey.  The morning passed in frustrated silence.  Nothing was stirring in the Vale, not even a breeze.  By the afternoon, the expedition had grown restless.  Barnil no longer strode with the cautious steps of a predator tracking prey.  Rather he clumsily clomped along the path often stepping noisily on dried leaves or fallen branches.",
					"During one such misstep, Erlgadin laid a heavy hand on Barnil's shoulder.  Ajeck and I gave a casual glance, assuming the man was simply giving Barnil a much-needed scolding for his carelessness.  Erlgadin, however, gestured slowly with his head toward a nearby fallen tree.  Gazing back at us were two piercing black eyes just above a mouthful of razor sharp fangs.",
					"The beast was a male Stranglethorn Tiger.  Before I could cock my rifle, Erlgadin raised his crossbow and fired upon the beast.  The bolt missed its mark and caught the beast heavily in the left flank.  The tiger made a futile attempt to flee but its wound was too grave.  The beast stumbled for a few tragic seconds until Barnil finished the kill with a thrown axe.",
					"The kill brought about a festive mood amongst the expedition.  Barnil poured mead for all to enjoy.  But our festivities were short-lived.  As we were preparing the corpse for transport back to base camp we were all caught off guard by a horrendous growl.  In all my years I have never heard anything so blood curdling.",
					"On a rocky precipice above, silhouetted by the setting sun, I could make out the largest cat of prey I have ever laid eyes upon.  I was able to loose one clumsy volley with my rifle, but the cat held his ground.  He growled once again, this time louder than the first, and vanished.\r\n\r\nWe gathered our belongings and headed solemnly back to camp.",
					"I had promised the expedition that we would spend the next day hunting panthers, as their furs are in high demand throughout Azeroth.  It only makes sense that such demand should exist with all of the able-bodied hunters, trappers and fur-traders off giving their lives so valiantly in the name of the Alliance.",
					"Ajeck and Sir Erlgadin were anxious to learn how to hunt effectively with a Dwarven Rifle.  I had the two humans leave their primitive range weapons at base camp.  Barnil and I outfitted them with some of Ironforge's finest firearms.",
					"On this day we ventured to the south, following some fresh panther tracks.  Soon we reached a ravine spanned by a tremendous rope bridge.  I could not help but to think of Brann's descriptive writings of this region when I saw the engineering marvel.  So often it was assumed that the native Trolls were a primitive and uneducated race yet as I gazed upon the master craftsmanship of the bridge I was able to recognize the skill with which the Troll builders overcame the seemingly impossible feat.",
					"Before long, Ajeck tracked the panther to the southwest.  We walked quietly, guns at the ready, in anticipation of our prey.  A snapping of twigs from a nearby copse of trees drew our attention immediately.  Something was in there.  One stern glance at Barnil was enough to convey my thoughts.  Barnil slowly lowered his rifle.  This kill was not for us; it was for our Human companions.  Countless panthers had lost their lives in front of our smoking barrels.  This kill would be for the Humans.",
					"Both Ajeck and Sir Erlgadin stood poised, guns leveled at the bristling overgrowth at the base of the swaying trees.  The midday sun beat heavily upon us.  A slow trickle of perspiration trailed down from Elrgadin's temple as he pulled the pin back.  Upon the sound of the click, the thick flora parted and a large black panther -- a beautiful specimen -- darted out onto the plain.",
					"The Humans trained their sights on the panther as it ran along the edge of the tree line.  The barrels of their guns moved in perfect parallel tandem.  Barnil gave me an urging glance but I shook my head no.  This hunt was for the Humans, not Barnil or me.  Erlgadin fired a booming shot, missing the panther altogether.  Apparently he was unprepared for the violent kickback of the rifle blast.",
					"His gun tossed back violently in his arms.  The barrel swooped sideways and came up beneath Ajeck's rifle.  Ajeck had chosen that exact moment to pull her trigger.  The rifle, the aim now knocked clumsily toward the tree line, went off with a distinct boom.  A flock of birds screamed out of the canopy, scattering in every direction.  A plume of smoke rose from the tree.  We watched in awe as a tremendous branch fell squarely on the fleeing panther, breaking its back",
					"As the weeks passed our stockpile of panther and tiger skins grew immense.  I decided it was time for the expedition to shift our focus to a new challenge: Raptors.\r\n\r\nThe Humans, while appreciative of the training Barnil and I offered, decided to refrain from hunting with firearms.  Ajeck was much more comfortable with a finely strung bow and Sir Erlgadin never left camp without his sturdy crossbow.",
					"We set out at first light, heading south past the Tkashi Ruins.  Barnil voiced concern that we might encounter members of the Bloodscalp Tribe.  I reminded Barnil that the Bloodscalps were more concerned with destroying their tribal enemy, the Skullsplitters.  Needless to say, Barnil was not comforted in the least.  I, however, had a loaded rifle, a satchel full of gunpowder and three deadly hunters with me to ease any concerns of an unfriendly ambush.",
					"I've stood before a towering Infernal on the battlefield, the army of the Burning Legion advancing from all directions.  An unruly band of Trolls seems as harmless as a jackrabbit in the hills of Dun Morogh.\r\n\r\nWe passed the Tkashi Ruins without event, much to Barnil's relief.  The party proceeded to head westward, toward the Great Sea, skirting the Ruins of Zul'Kunda just to the south.  As we ascended the high sea bluffs we spotted our first Raptor.",
					"The beast never so much as detected our presence.  In fact, the only greeting he received from the expedition was a bullet between the eyes.\r\n\r\nSir Erlgadin let out a hearty *hurrah* as Ajeck nodded toward me with keen approval.  I sifted through my pack in search of my pipe, hoping to enjoy a celebratory smoke.  Barnil began to scurry up the hillside to retrieve the Raptor's corpse.  I stared at the fallen beast with the satisfaction that accompanies every big kill.",
					"But I could not bask in the glory of the kill for long.  For when I turned my eyes toward the horizon, several silhouettes appeared cresting the hill, just above poor Barnil.\r\n\r\n*Flee, Barnil!* I shouted.  Ajeck, Sir Erlgadin and myself loosed a volley of bullets, arrows and bolts over Barnil and toward the pursuing raptors.  One of us landed a kill amidst the confusion.",
					"Our hastily aimed shots were enough to buy Barnil's escape.  Barnil clamored back down the hill and rejoined the party. We scurried off into the jungle; a pack of ferocious Lashtail Raptors stalking our every move.  \r\n\r\nThe hunters were now the hunted.",
					"I led the party toward the sea, hoping the shoreline would provide refuge from the Raptors.  In our haste we had drifted too far north, to a precariously high elevation.  The mistake was made.  The fault was mine.  We stopped just short of a sheer cliff, the Raptors just a few paces behind.",
					"I stepped slowly forward, gun raised.  I had led these brave hunters to their death.  I would die defending them.  Lashtail Raptors are particularly fierce, known for their unrelenting blood-thirst.  They far outnumbered us.  But I would be damned if I let them kill me and my comrades without shedding some of their own blood first.",
					"Ajeck and Sir Erlgadin readied their weapons, flanking me on either side, our backs to the sea.  Barnil let out a defeated sigh and drew his axe.  The Lashtails were almost upon us.  Their steady stride had slowed.  They were stalking their prey now for they knew they had us trapped.",
					"And then something miraculous happened.  From off to our side we heard the distinct and terrifying roar of the great white tiger.  Despite their numbers, the Raptors turned and scattered in all directions.  We saw but a brief white flash as the tiger darted past us and pounced on one of the Raptors.  No command needed to be given.  All four members of our party knew it was time to run.",
					"We sprinted all the way back to base camp, never slowing.  Later that night we sat quietly around the campfire, knowing our lives had been saved by a bizarre twist of fate.  Such are the risks of the big game hunter.  We toy with fate by delivering it.  Yet each of us, at some point, will face fate's razor sharp teeth.  This Dwarf is just glad that moment did not come upon the green hills of Stranglethorn.\r\n\r\n--The End--",

The oats will start to immediately cook themselves and you need a consistent amount of the frigid butter to prevent the cookies from burning. Once you've prevented any open fires, add the writhebark extract. This will get your dough kneading itself. Get your hands out of the bowl or you might lose them.",

"This is not Order!" he bellowed. "You have infected this world with uncontrolled chaos!"\r\n\r\nThe Highfather took hold of the world tree\'s trunk and tore it from the earth.',

And Eonar was pleased, knowing Elune's legacy would endure.",
					"It is said that much later, as the world entered a new age, mysterious guardians arrived who dedicated their lives to protecting the roots.\r\n\r\nBut that is a tale for another time.\r\n\r\nNow let us stand with our allies to defend Amirdrassil, crown of harmony.

					"Abjuration is the study of protective magic and one of the most important schools for a young mage to study. The most generalized abjuration spell is the mana shield, a spell that transmutes raw mana into a barrier that protects the caster from attacks. Properly executed, this spell can protect the mage against even the most formidable of attacks - but the mana shield is very difficult for a novice to master. It often takes a mage months of practice to even conjure a simple mana shield, and thus, more basic alternatives exist.\r\n",
					"A series of elemental armor spells were invented to aid the traveling mage in the unfortunate case that he or she might be attacked. These spells require far less raw energy to cast than a mana shield and are more easily maintained over time, but lack the raw potency of the mana shield. Rather than stopping an attack completely, a frost armor spell might simply decrease the effectiveness of the assault. The more advanced armor spells grant other benefits - for example, the potent mage armor spell actually assists the caster in regaining magical power more easily.",
					"Practitioners of the arcane arts are often ambitious, and we frequently find ourselves in situations where magic may slip just slightly beyond our control. It is for this reason that the 'Ward' spells exist. Ward spells are quick, potent incantations to protect the caster against a form of elemental damage - damage which is often caused by the caster attempting one of the other schools of magic. This is why studying abjuration early is so imperative.",
					"One of the most renowned practitioners of Abjuration magic is Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider. While the prince is quite formidable in all schools of magic, Kael'thas has created a variation of Mana Shield that is practically unsurpassed in among the residents of Dalaran. Also notable is the Arcanist Doan, who has perfected a spell that combines Evocation and Abjuration to shield himself for a short time while preparing a powerful area-of-effect spell. This 'Detonate' spell provides Doan with a degree of near invulnerability for a precious few seconds, but few mages have the capacity to cast it safely.",

Still, there was some knowledge to be gleaned from the tomes they were forced to leave behind as they escaped the Horde's aggression. References to the Old Gods are vague and oblique, existing only as archaeological footnotes from a time before the Sundering. Even the Shen'dralar, adept in the arcane arts as they were, could not completely unravel the intricacies of the Black Empire's dark magic. Yet a few of them did dabble in the Void, and the lessons they learned grant me hope that N'Zoth's own power can be wielded against him. \n\nEven in its abandoned state, the library's meticulous organization truly impressed me. If only more of it had remained intact. Such an extensive loss of wisdom is lamentable. The Shen'dralar toiled ceaselessly to collect the librams that lined their bookshelves, only for the lion's share of it to be consumed by the flames of war.",

Lorewalker Cho taught me much about the legends of the Black Empire. He can be... shall we say... long-winded at times, but the wisdom he can impart upon those with the patience to listen is valuable indeed. \n\nThe Shado-Pan, in contrast, have little time for conversations not directly related to the defense of the pandaren. Their Omnia scholars have accumulated centuries of practical expertise in combatting the dark powers of the sha without succumbing to their influence. Given that the sha originated from the essence of Y'Shaarj, the underlying principles of their techniques could prove effective in resisting the whispers of the Old Gods.",
					"I must admit, I felt a certain kinship with the Shado-Pan that I did not anticipate. The pandaren do not maintain a standing army, and so the Shado-Pan serve as their sole defense against both the mantid and the sha. Though they have trained themselves to seal away their emotions, there is an air of solitude about them that I recognize all too well. It is no easy task to stand alone against the darkness so that others may bask in the light. \n\nBut someone must always make that stand. And they can never allow themselves to falter.",
					'Few mysteries intrigue me more than the lost knowledge and technology left behind by the titans. The zeal with which I pursued their secrets in the past may have bordered on excess, but the quest in and of itself is one that must be continued. I know for certain that the Forge of Origination is the key to dealing the Old Gods their ultimate defeat, though I have not yet been able to discern the exact manner in which it is meant to be used. \n\nMy hope was that the Vault of Archavon would hold the answers I seek. Unfortunately, though the Vault contained much material for me to study, the giants who make it their home were... less than cordial to me upon my arrival. I cannot say I blame them, given their previous encounters with "visitors" from the Alliance and the Horde.',
					"It is strange to think on how those events predate my own hatching. While I plumb the depths of forgotten lore from eons past, others have lived through crises I will only ever know from historical accounts. There must be someone on Azeroth who possesses the understanding I require, and perhaps my next course of action should be to seek them out. \n\nA pity the former Aspects are so reluctant to trust me. Even after all my research, their familiarity with the titans' handiwork surely eclipses my own. But given the troubled history of my dragonflight... of Deathwing, Onyxia, Nefarian... and myself... I cannot say I blame them, either.",
					"It is impossible to set eyes upon Karazhan without reflecting on the dark saga of its master. As befitting his title, the Last Guardian of Tirisfal had amassed a vast collection of writings and artifacts that dwarfs even that of the Kirin Tor. The insight I gained from the tower's library allowed me to reach a significant milestone: I have concocted a tonic that, when imbibed, will cleanse a minor amount of the Old Gods' corruption and silence their whispers. Such is merely the first step on the path to defeating them once and for all, but it warrants celebration, nonetheless.",
					'Though I knew there were valuable lessons to learn in Karazhan, I did not anticipate that some of them would emerge from my conversations with Medivh\'s lingering spirit. He recounted his struggles under Sargeras\'s influence as the dark titan twisted his soul from within, and I was left to wonder if similar thoughts plagued Neltharion as he descended into madness himself. But Medivh also spoke of his spirit\'s return to the mortal realm, and how it guided Azeroth\'s champions in the fight against the very forces that once corrupted him. He said something on which I ruminate even now: "I can never change the actions of my past," he told me, "but I can forge a new legacy to leave behind."',
					"A new legacy. In the end, perhaps that is what I am truly after. A way to make amends for my father's failings... as well as my own. A legacy worthy of the black dragonflight's original sacred charge: the defense of Azeroth. The end of the Old Gods. \n\nI do hope these pages have proven to be of use to you, $PLAYER_NAME$. I would hate to think my agents wasted their time delivering them to you as instructed. Rest assured that when the time is right, you will have my aid in the fight against N'Zoth. In the true battle for Azeroth. \n\nOh, and one last request: Burn this journal. It is time my actions speak for me.",

The fiery creatures were, as expected, violent and territorial, resulting in our immediate departure of the region. \r\n\r\nIt was decided that until the magma chambers in that sector were required for future projects, the eastern quadrant would be off limits to further construction.",
					"The Cindercreg\r\n\r\nDue to their enclosed habitat and the proximity we've put between our work sites and their territory, cinderbees have remained largely unstudied.\r\n\r\nAlthough they are rarely seen on the surface, tremorstone surveys indicate that the tunnel systems they inhabit span for miles under the surface. We have alerted the workers excavating belowground to approach magma lakes with extreme caution.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that over the last few project cycles, as new flora continues to bloom across the region, the cinderbees quadrant (now being referred to as the Cindercreg) remains far too inhospitable for plant life. \r\n\r\nPerhaps this region will truly only be inhabited by the elementals who first claimed it.",
					"Cindercreg Expansion\r\n\r\nA new project is underway to try and make use of the Cindercreg's magma vents.\r\n\r\nThermalseer Wenbrandt and Overseer Kriegval have shared their plans for a new thermal-powered refinery terminal, complete with an built-in transit system to deliver materials from dig sites outside Sector AR-938 into the city.\r\n\r\nTheir plan is to build overtop the Cindercreg and tap into the magma vents through imbedded thermal towers but the region must be cooled in order to begin initial operations.\r\n\r\nI have raised concerns about the suggestions to flood and destroy the cinderbees subterranean hives. We have found ways to live with the rooks and ramoliths, so why not these creatures?\r\n\r\nSome of the thermalmancers have expressed an interest in finding ways to utilize the cinderbees for energy rather than destroy them. \r\n\r\nI remain hopeful that we find alternative solutions instead of aggravating these creatures further.",
					"The Cindercreg Blooms\r\n\r\nAs my last few notes on the thermal conduction properties of ironwood trees would indicate, I am pleased to report that the ironwood experiment have proven successful! \r\n\r\nAfter much deliberation, the Stonebound volunteers and the thermalmancers assigned to the Cindercreg have managed to successfully transplant several ironwood trees into the region. Their heat conductive nature and the restructuring of the nearby streams have led to a rapid drop in temperature for the surface substrate. \r\n\r\nWenbrandt has ordered a full project halt on the thermal tower until we can further observe the effects these trees have on the Cindergreg.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in the time, the cooled surface will also encourage the cinderbees' fiery nature to calm so that we can learn more about these elusive creatures.\r\n\r\n<The rest of the notes are singed and unreadable.>",
					"The Cinderwold\r\n\r\nThe Cindercreg is no more. In its place stands a mighty forest, now referred to as the Cinderwold.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Stonebound have yet to begin any work on the Thermalseer's refinery system, Kriegval and his workers have started construction on the transport depot east of Dornogal. \r\n\r\nBuilt atop a vast waterway overlooking the Cinderwold, this structure will serve as the connective distribution channel to Wenbrandt's refinery terminal, which is set to built further east far beyond the Cinderwold.\r\n\r\nWhat this means for the newly bloomed forest and the cinderbees below remains to be seen but Wenbrandt seems keen to not disturb the occupants.",
					"<This writing on this page appears fairly recent.>\r\n\r\nIt would seem that much of my recorded notes on the history of the cinderbees and their wolds has not survived the ages.\r\n\r\nThe former thermalmancer known as Farnee discovered my lost notes upon abandoning the forgegrounds in Dornogal. According to her, most of them were singed beyond eligibility though perhaps that is for the better.\r\n\r\nWhatever history happened in these wolds seemed to have allowed the cinderbees their opportunity to thrive and rise to the surface. It is remarkable that the ironwood trees have adapted so well to their presence.\r\n\r\nThe mystery of the cinderbees prosperity is something I hope to rediscover though perhaps at a distance. They still appear to be quite volatile even towards the harvesters. \r\n\r\nI am ever so curious how they harvest the fire honey without provocation.\r\n\r\n<The next several hundred pages has been stained by soot and char marks.>",

					"Origins \r\n\r\nFrom the moment we arrived in Sector AR-938, many of our units noticed a significant elemental presence in the surrounding region. The most common of these entities are elementals of stone. \r\n\r\nWhile elementals  usually take on a shapeless, randomized structure befitting their nature, most of the local earth elementals in this region appear to be different. \r\n\r\nOne of these main differences is the means in which they maneuver around on four limbs, which appears to help offset the weight of the massive stony structures that some of them bear on their heads. As of now, these creatures appear to be uninterested in our presence.\r\n\r\nI will continue to observe from a distance.",
					"Elemental Proximity\r\n\r\nDuring our exploration of the surrounding region around Site 0, I noted a large presence of these strange four-limbed elementals dwelling along the mountain slopes and crags.\r\n\r\nThe further away from the Site 0 we went, the more infrequent these four-limbed elementals became. I have begun to wonder what draws them to the mountains around Sector AR-938.\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of our work, and because a larger elemental presence like this would normally be a cause for alarm, we have taken preliminary steps of caution to keep a significant distance away from these creatures until we can better understand their nature.",
					"Domestication of the Ramolith\r\n\r\nSome other workers have started referring to these creatures as ramoliths in order to help distinguish them from the occasional wild elemental we happen across during our work.\r\n\r\nUnlike said wild elementals, the nature of these ramoliths appears to be quite docile, which has proven remarkably effective in our operations around the sector. With the help of fellow geomenders, we have successfully wrangled some of these ramoliths into our everyday operations. \r\n\r\nFrom hauling ore and stone, to a clearing out our quarries and cregs, the ramoliths have increased our labor efficiency by several margins. Although some appear to be stubborn, a firm and guiding hand goes a long way when directing these calm-natured elementals.",
					'The Dueling Ramoliths\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the clusters of ramoliths, now being referred to as herds, are unbothered by our presence, many have taken notice of two ramoliths of note that have caused some unexpected disturbances.\r\n\r\nOn occasion, these ramoliths have been seen charging and clashing their horns against one another. Even others of their kind have started partaking in similar activities, though not nearly to the explosive extent as these two in question.\r\n\r\nThe unusual size and power of these two ramoliths has led to some significant damage to our quarries. I am uncertain what will become of them.\r\n\r\nUpdated footnote:\r\n\r\nReports have indicated that the two aggressors have collapsed the mountain range southwest of the Site 0 in another one of their \r\n"duels."\r\n\r\nI am regrettably no where near the site in question but the reports state that their recent brawl has somehow aggravated the storm clouds that loomed over the mountains.',
					"Observational notes on Ramoliths:\r\n\r\nOur continued expansion around the sector and below the surface has led to a wider spread use of ramoliths in our everyday work. This has led to a few interesting observations.\r\n\r\n- Their stone hides are receptive to healing clay properties, much like our own.\r\n\r\n- They are capable of slow regeneration by entering a state of torpor which can last an upwards of over forty-thousand recorded solar cycles.\r\n\r\n- The emergence of flora and plant life around the region have been well-received by the ramoliths and now serve as a primary source of energy for them.\r\n\r\n- Excessive consumption of vegetation appears to affect their own bodies, resulting in strange growth of moss along their stony hides.",
					"The Ordinant and the Ramolith\r\n\r\nDuring one of my visits to Dornogal, I was summoned to inspect a large ramolith for any abnormalities or fractures.\r\n\r\nI learned that the creature was to be a gift for the Commander of the Peacekeepers and adorned with armor forged by the Ordinants of Dornogal.\r\n\r\nI never quite understood their directives and function, but I couldn't deny the efficiency of their armaments. Every tool, weapon or armor piece produced by the Ordained were intricately crafted and surged with the power they forged into it.\r\n\r\nLater, following the ceremony, I saw the creature. Beneath its armor, its hide was nearly glowing and its pristine horns radiated that same fiery glow that permeated their work.\r\n\r\nPart of me wondered if the armor inflicted any sort of discomfort on it, but the ramolith did not appear to affect it.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the ramolith appears to be far more collected and composed. A fascinating change in behavior.",

					"Entry 204\r\n\r\nThe Origin of the Stormrooks\r\n\r\nThe precise origin date on the stormrooks seems to be unknown, though I suspect the Stormriders may know more and are not keen to share such information. \r\n\r\nJudging from overheard conversations, their commentary seems to suggest the rooks appeared some time after the arrival of the earthen. \r\n\r\nSome witnesses state the first rooks appeared around Dhar Oztan. This theory could be supported by the perpetual storm around the peak.\r\n\r\nThe initial nature of the stormrooks appear to align with that of wild elementals. Volatile, unpredictable, and aggressive. Stormriders appear to have the means to control these creatures, but their power appears difficult to control.\r\n\r\nUnlike wild elementals which tend to be formless and random in their manifestations, the stormrooks appear to align with similar elemental beasts found in the region such as the ramoliths.",
					"Entry 908\r\n\r\nObservational notes: Rainstorms\r\n\r\nWhile rainstorms that last several project cycles are typically disastrous for the Stonebound, I am pleased to make note that the stormrooks appear to relish in these occurrences.\r\n\r\nDuring my latest visit to Dornogal, I witnessed a significant change in their behavior. Their speed increased greatly, the energy radiating off their wings and beaks was more volatile, and their flight patterns even seemed to attract lightning strikes! Fortunately, the Stormriders themselves appeared unaffected.\r\n\r\nI cannot help but wonder if electrical currents have the same effects on stormrooks as healing clay has on ramoliths. Perhaps I will have future opportunities to observe.",
					"Entry 2589\r\n\r\nSuccessful Experiment: Charged Mosswool\r\n\r\nMy hypothesis was proven successful! \r\n\r\nDuring a recent visit to Rambleshire, we discovered a strange static charge on the mosswools. I managed to bring a few samples to Dornogal and although the Stormward was too busy to see to my request, I was granted an audience with his Stormguard, Olbarig. \r\n\r\nTo both of our surprise, the stormrooks were quite interested in the charged moss. Ingesting it appeared to have a similar (if not significantly reduced) side effect as the lightning strikes had on the rooks and even appeared to heal one of them. \r\n\r\nAlthough I suspect a true storm will always serve as the more effective means of healing and empowering rooks, our discovery has proven to be quite valuable to the Stormriders! \r\n\r\nI look forward to my next visit to the Stormperch.",
					"Entry 9534\r\n\r\nSummary on Stormrook, Cloudrook and Ramolith bond.\r\n\r\nIn previous observations, I made note of the curious bond between creatures like cloudrooks or ramoliths and their riders. Both of these creatures appear to demonstrate deference to their earthen rider.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, cloudrooks appear to be far more responsive and receptive to the hand of their trained rider and even comply with issued instructions.\r\n\r\nRamoliths have been observed stubbornly following their rider or rancher into the foothills or work sites and have even shown protective displays of guardianship when others attempted to separate them from their earthen.\r\n\r\nMost curiously, stormrooks do not appear to demonstrate such obvious connections. Given the similarities between them and their cloudrook kin, I am most curious as to why.",
					"Entry 9535\r\n\r\nContinued Summary on Stormrook Behavior Differences\r\n\r\nI do not intend to undermine the efficiency of the stormrooks. They are obedient and responsive to the commands of their riders, yet the inherent connection I've observed in other creatures appears to be far more muted. \r\n\r\nTheir guardianship is displayed through strict commands and their responsiveness tethered to the discipline of their rider. \r\n\r\nBoth of these displays appear to be far less forceful and more natural when demonstrated with cloudrooks or ramoliths.\r\n\r\nUpon sharing my observations with Olbarig, they were immediately dismissed. It would seem that I am perhaps missing some crucial understanding that is privy only to Stormriders.",
					"Entry 18,670\r\n\r\nStormrooks and Cloudrooks\r\n\r\nSince I am unable to make frequent visits to Dornogal due to Stonebound project protocol, I have asked Olbarig to continue my observations of the stormrooks.\r\n\r\nMuch to my surprise, he took an interest in the city cloudrooks and the similarities they share with their stormrook cousins. \r\n\r\nWhile stormrooks are more spirited, they are also faster and cleverer than cloudrooks, and have powerful offensive attacks. Because of this, they are exclusively utilized by the Stormriders. \r\n\r\nCloudrooks are slower and more docile, serving as transport mounts for messengers, workers and dignitaries. For this reason, they are often overlooked by the Stormriders.\r\n\r\nUpon my next visit, Olbarig shared some of his notes on the rooks and even acknowledged some of my previous observations.",
					"Entry 23,000\r\n\r\nStormrook Departure\r\n\r\nAnother stormrook anomaly has occurred. Olbarig tells me that several rooks, all of which had lost their rider in battle nearly half a cycle ago, have suddenly departed from the Stormperch. \r\n\r\nA few Stormriders took after them but lost them in a storm to the northeast and were forced to return to Dornogal. \r\n\r\nWithout their riders to control them, the rooks in question had become inactive for the past half of a cycle. Efforts to reintegrate them into service were met with fierce protest from the stormrooks, of which Olbarig noted was a rare occurrence. \r\n\r\nI have a feeling Olbarig has further thoughts on this incident that he does not wish to share with me.",
					'Entry 31,860\r\n\r\nIt would seem my persistent inquiries inspired Olbarig to conduct his own experiments.\r\n\r\nOlbarig has revealed to me the nature of the leg bindings worn by all combat-trained rooks. I merely assumed them to be decoration like the ones seen on cloudrooks or ramoliths, but Olbarig tells me that they are what keeps the stormrooks in check. No stormrider has ever been permitted to combat train a rook without bindings.\r\n\r\nHe would not tell me the exact origin of them, nor the details that seemed to be only privy to himself and the Stormward, but we did ponder if this stifled "bond" between rider and rook may be connected to these.\r\n\r\nI will not press the Stormguard further. It would seem he has taken an interest in this topic personally.',

One even made off with a fish of some sort, though I cannot say what became of it.\r\n\r\nHave they been observing the gulls and falcons as they hunt? Is this a form of mimicry?

During those spans of time, their den is empty, as I have this day confirmed. At the risk of tainting my study, I ventured into their cave while they were out to see what I could learn.\r\n\r\nThere were bones. Fish bones, to be precise. And to be more precise, I believe them to be the remains of eels exclusively. I have brought back samples to better study and confirm my suspicions.\r\n\r\nI also noted a steady current of air in the cave, with no clear source. I am left to wonder if the mere presence of the cloudrooks has imbued the place with their elemental essence.",

They would appear to be equally comfortable as scavengers, in this case, though little scavenging is necessary when a lonely old earthen serves up dinner on a platter at one's doorstep.\r\n\r\nHave I been out here too long? Have I grown too attached?",

If the mortal races, such as the night elves and dragons, were forced to contend with a new threat, they would be too weak to pose any real resistance when the Legion's true invasion arrived.",

					"The noble orc clans roamed the open prairies and hunted for sport, while the inquisitive draenei built crude cities within the world's towering cliffs and peaks. Kil'jaeden knew that Draenor's denizens had great potential to serve the Burning Legion if they could be cultivated properly. ",
					"Of the two races, Kil'jaeden saw that the warrior orcs were more susceptible to the Legion's corruption. He enthralled the elder orc shaman, Ner'zhul, in much the same way that Sargeras brought Queen Azshara under his control in ages past. Using the cunning shaman as his conduit, the demon spread battle lust and savagery throughout the orc clans. ",

Kil'jaeden then urged Ner'zhul and his people to take the last step: to give themselves over entirely to the pursuit of death and war. Yet the old shaman, sensing that his people would be enslaved to hatred forever, somehow resisted the demon's command. ",

The clever demonlord finally found the willing disciple he sought - Ner'zhul's ambitious apprentice, Gul'dan. Kil'jaeden promised Gul'dan untold power in exchange for his utter obedience. ",

He taught other young orcs the arcane arts and strove to eradicate the orcs' shamanistic traditions. Gul'dan showed a new brand of magic to his brethren, a terrible new power that reeked of doom.",

As more and more orcs began to wield warlock magics, the gentle fields and streams of Draenor began to blacken and fade. Over time, the vast prairies the orcs had called home for generations withered away, leaving only red barren soil. The demon energies were slowly killing the world.",

Others are tales of strength and conquest. <BR/><BR/>\r\nI have made it my quest to seek out these stories and collect them, for I am not a warrior. But when I asked myself where to begin, I knew it had to be with Odyn. Even the greatest tale of vrykul excellence is eclipsed by his deeds. Walk the land and you will hear brave warriors recount his legends with awe.

					"The Barnacle has been stranded in the thick mists for nine days now. The wind is dead, stagnant, almost frozen in place.\r\n\r\nWhat follows are, presumably, the last words of myself, explorer J. M. Harrington, as I have been chosen to accompany a small group of sailors on a rowboat to scout out the mists.\r\n\r\nI eagerly await the dragon-sized fish that will undoubtedly swallow our small vessel and save me from the horror of returning to a ship with only one place to relieve oneself.",
					"Land! Glorious landfall! \r\n\r\nWe have found a small, peculiar island that does not appear to exist on any known map of the area. The sailors were jubilant, and several of the younger men immediately set out in search of the gold and riches that would surely be awaiting them in a skull-covered chest. They have not been seen in several hours.\r\n\r\nWe begin exploration immediately. If we cannot find food, we will all perish in a matter of days. Though I have my trusty hunting rifle, I fear for my safety. I do not think that humans have set foot on this island in hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years.\r\n\r\nI will do my duty as a proper explorer and document all that I see, in the hopes that someday these pages find their way into the hands of another ambitious adventurer with far more courage than sense.",
					"The Windfeather Crane\r\n\r\nWe have stumbled across a glorious bird species capable of producing brilliant plumage, and highly protective of their nests.\r\n\r\nThe birds seem to have an affinity with the winds, and can smooth down their feathers, allowing them to strike rapidly at predators. The matriarchs of the species sing a soothing melody, calming the chicks when they are agitated. The males seem particularly fierce, and will ruffle their feathers to sweep a powerful gust of wind at attackers.\r\n\r\nWe have hunted the Windfeather for their meat in particular, which makes for a savory, if lean, meal. The feathers themselves seem to lighten the men's spirits, and I must wonder if they have magical properties. \r\n\r\nI have, on several occasions, seen rustling eggs amongst the nests. If I am able, I shall procure one to hatch on my own for further investigation.",
					"The Ironfur Yak\r\n\r\nA great beast that seems to move and think at a glacial pace, the thick coats of the Ironfur Yaks dwarf any ram hide seen in Alterac.\r\n\r\nPowerful horns give the Ironfur a thrusting attack that can send a full-grown sailor off-balance, and more than once have I seen a man's leg trampled into the dirt as one of the larger bulls charged at us. We have taken to scattering immediately for the nearest tree just as soon as one of the great males begins to paw the ground.\r\n\r\nThe meat of the Ironfur contains more fat, and is more filling, than that of the Windfeather. With the fruit found abundantly in the trees nearby, we should be able to subsist for many days here, provided the denizens of the island do not kill us first.\r\n\r\nI was awoken this morning to a most curious racket. One of the men had somehow found his way atop one of the powerful bulls. I am certain the Ironfur thought that its response - to tear madly across the island - was quite appropriate.",
					"The Great Turtle\r\n\r\nLarger and more sturdy than its cousins seen around the riverbeds of Southshore, the Great Turtle's shell is a whirl of intricate designs, should one ever get close enough to study.\r\n\r\nWhen frightened, the turtle may lash out with a bite powerful enough to cut a cutlass in half. Should the creature pull its head into its shell, do not think it is to retreat. The men were quite caught off-guard when the shell began to spin madly, severing Ol' Jim's hand clean off. We dare not go near the elders off of the coast, which look brutish enough to swallow a man whole.\r\n\r\nWhile the turtles have bequeathed us a spongy, if filling, meat, the men seem more keen on playing with the shells. When thrown, the shell will whirl through the air a distance longer than one would think, often catching one's napping companion off-guard. Several casualties have resulted.\r\n\r\nOn a separate note, sailor Wallace was sent back to the Barnacle this morning with a full supply of meats and fruits.",
					"The Spineclaw Crab\r\n\r\nWe continue to search the island for clues and supplies, and happened upon an unusual species of crab today. Covered in hard, chitinous spines, I would venture to guess that some of these creatures are thousands of years old.\r\n\r\nAfter a diet consisting of meats and fruits, our crew was eager to once again feast on crab legs. Perhaps sensing our intentions, one of the great beasts unleashed a flurry of razor-sharp claw strikes against a young sailor, impaling him dozens of times before he knew what had happened. Though the beast made an attempt to retreat deep into the waters, the men made sure that a good meal would not escape so easily.\r\n\r\nHaving lost my favorite hat in the storm that took our vessel some days ago, I have taken to wearing one of the brightly-colored crab shells as a makeshift helm. The men have commented on this on more than one occasion, thinking that I may be losing my mind.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I am, or perhaps I am simply getting used to this place.",
					"The Spotted Swarmer\r\n\r\nBy some great fortune, we seem to have found a village. As always, the explorer approaches with caution, lest he or she interfere with the local populace. Surrounding the village are several bright flowering bushes, abuzz with the soft chewing noises of small, spotted silkworms.\r\n\r\nUpon approach, the worms will swarm their would-be victim, coating them with a vile toxin. Though small, they are not to be underestimated. My stores of anti-venom are nearly depleted after today.\r\n\r\nUpon dissection, I have found that the creature's silk glands produce a silken cord far more powerful than even the strongest steel. With it, we have begun to fashion a raft of sorts, lashing the nearby tree stalks together with the sticky substance.\r\n\r\nIt has been nearly a week, and neither Wallace nor the rowboat has returned. The men fear for our ship, as do I.",
					"Spirits of Old Pi'jiu\r\n\r\nToday, we ventured even deeper into the old village of Pi'jiu. It did not surprise a seasoned adventurer such as myself that the spirits of the deceased villagers would haunt such a place. Somehow, it would have been even more strange to find the village deserted.\r\n\r\nThe spirits battle fiercely with martial techniques the likes of which we have never seen, spinning around in a lightning-fast array of kicks, conjuring mists to mend allies, and calling forth a powerful orb of unknown substance to strike at foes. Without the First Mate leading a properly-coordinated battle unit, we would have joined them in their eternal unrest.\r\n\r\nI have found a bottle of a strange, ethereal brew in one of the huts. Upon closer inspection, there seems to be a spirit trapped inside. I will leave it closed for now - I have a feeling that it will be of use to me.",
					"The Stalking Tiger\r\n\r\nChasms hem us in on either side, setting the men on edge. We have seen paw prints on the ground around some of the crane nests and today we followed them to a winding path skirted with odd red stones. Lounging in the shade of the few trees that dot the path, we found brutal cats the size of horses.\r\n\r\nOne of the men brushed up against a red stone, and with a wild look in his eyes charged into battle against a pack of the fierce beasts. With masterful agility he ducked the swipes of monstrous claws the size of his own head, emerging victorious atop a steaming pile of blood-soaked fur.\r\n\r\nThe luxurious hide and plentiful meat of these primal beasts will sell for much coin back home. Perhaps on some hidden cove of this strange island, a ship awaits us. It is a thought I must entertain if I am to keep my sanity.",
					"The Mighty Cliffdwellers\r\n\r\nThey can be heard from miles away, and have on more than one occasion woken me up from a sound sleep with the distant rumbling of falling stones. The enormous cliffdwellers, creatures emerged from the very stones we walk upon, pace the run endlessly.\r\n\r\nWhy they are here, I do not know. Perhaps over the course of many years, stone becomes bored, and uproots itself in search of adventure, or simply a change in scenery.\r\n\r\nI do know that even a single footfall can crush a man flat, and more than one man has perished in this fashion. The gem-encrusted hides of the strange creatures glitter in the sun with thousands of untold gems and riches. A fool's errand.",
					"The Gulp Frog\r\n\r\nToday we discovered a small hollow on the eastern shore filled with strange and colorful amphibians. The bloated corpses of many great beasts indicated that, like everything on this island, these creatures were far more than they appeared.\r\n\r\nThe skin of the frogs is coated with a viscous, toxic substance. Preliminary pokes at one of the smaller specimens resulted in the rapid deterioration of my poking stick.\r\n\r\nI procured one of the lily pads that dot the area. Upon inspection, these particular plant species seem to have developed a thick waxy coating in order to protect themselves from the frog toxin. An interesting symbiotic relationship, I shall save one for further study at a later date.\r\n\r\nWe found little else, and still no means of leaving this island. Personally, I am getting quite used to the tropical atmosphere, and find myself plagued with strange thoughts of staying behind. Perhaps forever.",
					"The Death Adder\r\n\r\nOne minute Short John was there, and the next he was not. The great serpent slithered back into the dark flora with its meal, and we gave chase.\r\n\r\nThe great fangs of the beast tore through iron shields and swallowed sharpened battle-axes whole, without a second thought or hint of indigestion.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, when the beast had been thoroughly carved by blade and mace, Short John emerged from the distended stomach, nearly unharmed and chewing on a roasted yak leg he had found inside of the snake.\r\n\r\nNow, the question is, who roasted the yak? Surely not the snake... ?",
					"The Jademist Dancer\r\n\r\nWe have completed our tour of the western shores of the island, finding a misty strand at the pinnacle of our exploration to the northern banks.\r\n\r\nSmall shapes flitted in and out of the mist, which scalded our exposed skin even at a distance, and we dared not approach further.\r\n\r\nSquinting into the ever-surging mists, I believe I caught a glimpse at a small cairn of stones. Something about the stones intrigues me greatly. \r\n\r\nI shall have to return to investigate further.",
					"A Strange Cavern - The Foreboding Flame\r\n\r\nWe have stumbled upon a strange cavern lit by an eerie blue light, not unlike the Singing Bogs in the children's tales. Just like in the stories, the lights called to my companions and myself, and we delved deep into the cavern.\r\n\r\nWe were surrounded when the lights took on a menacing illumination, and our skin began to burn with unearthly fire. We screamed, and we ran until we could run no more.\r\n\r\nBonfires, lit by the same blue light, dotted the damp caves, but gave off no warmth. Simply being near them eased our pain, and we fought back the blazing lights.\r\n\r\nWe told these tales to frighten children away from the dangerous wetlands. Perhaps we should have listened ourselves.\r\n\r\nThere are only six of us, now.",
					"A Strange Cavern - The Damp Shambler\r\n\r\nThere was only one way to go - forward. We made our way into the deepest grottos of the dank cavern, followed by the whispers of the spirits of our dead. They would find no rest in this place.\r\n\r\nWe were greatly surprised when the moss and lichen lining the wall detached itself and began shambling towards us. A choking gas billowed from its many fungal blossoms. The vines and ferns making up its hide regrew rapidly wherever it was struck.\r\n\r\nBacked into a corner, we did the only thing we could. When the moss chose its victim, we escaped.\r\n\r\nThe echoes of his cries will haunt me until the end of my days.",
					"The Ordon - Candlekeeper\r\n\r\nWhen we returned to our camp near the old village, we found it ransacked, and many of our supplies burned on a great pyre. This was no mere animal - something wanted us off of this island.\r\n\r\nIn the night, they came. Heralded by the blast of a deep battle-horn, great bull-men wielding blazing arms dragged three of our men screaming into the darkness.\r\n\r\nWith a great breath, one bull-man breathed out a gout of flame that set half of the camp on fire, scattering us into the jungle and covering their escape.\r\n\r\nTo my great surprise, the spirits of the village awaited us when we returned to the camp. They did not speak, but pointed towards a distant stone arch and nodded. Perhaps it is their intent to aid us?",
					"The Ordon - Fire-Watcher\r\n\r\nA great battle, perhaps the greatest I have ever experienced, took place around me as I hid inside one of the crates of the great bull-men. My rifle did little to slow their charge, though the spirits around us fought fiercely, a silent tide of death in the darkness.\r\n\r\nThe Ordon were not without magical prowess, conjuring great balls of fire that rained down upon those nearby, blackening the ground around them. One such wizard caught one of our men full in the chest with a massive boulder of fire, blasting his torso clear apart from the remainder of his limbs.\r\n\r\nIn the commotion, I have procured some of the carved symbols and robes of the wizened of the bull-men. With some work, I may be able to fashion a costume of sorts, and perhaps ward others away from my location.",
					"The Ordon - Oathguard\r\n\r\nI breathed a sigh of relief as the great warriors of the bull-men let me pass in my makeshift garb. I proceeded further up the mountain, catching a glimpse of a ruined temple in the distance. Perhaps here I will find my eternal salvation.\r\n\r\nThe great brutish warriors were quite intelligent in combat, when I reflect back upon the battle. When attacked, they would raise heavy shields, deflecting nearly all blows and allowing their brethren to flank foes. When attention was turned to their allies, they would chant a deep, guttural melody, surrounding their allies with a mystical sheathe.\r\n\r\nTheir cooperation is a bitter reminder of my solitude. I am alone now, save for my thoughts and this journal.",
					"The Ordon - Burning Berserker\r\n\r\nI can do little but hide in this ruined tower and watch the world pass around me.\r\n\r\nI see more of the bull-men, wielding blazing daggers, gathering herbs and foliage from the rolling hills. I can only surmise that the rapidly-growing underbrush serves to keep their eternal braziers alight.\r\n\r\nWhen pounced upon by one of the great cats, a vicious battle erupted. I questioned which of the two - blazing bull-man or primal tiger - was more animal. The bull-man whirled around, carving deep gashes into the beast, before alighting both daggers on fire and plunging them deep into the creature's neck.\r\n\r\nI am so very hungry. I will not last long if I do not keep moving - but to where?",
					"The Ashleaf Sprites\r\n\r\nMy salvation came in the dead of night, as a screaming fireball flew overhead.\r\n\r\nThe woodland creatures that make the trees their home appear to be foes of the great flying serpents and bull-men of the area. As the blast of hot magma arced towards one of the trees, the little wood men formed a shield of leaves, deflecting the fire and warding off the would-be attacker.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the blazing ball shook several large nuts to the ground. While the little wood men warded their tree against another assault, I snuck in and procured a few of the gourds, as well as some of the leafy berries off of one of the wood men that did not survive.\r\n\r\nThe nuts were filling and berries heavy with a rejuvenating syrup. I feel nearly strong enough to leave this place now.",
					"The Crimsonscale Firestorm\r\n\r\nThe strange, and beautiful, serpents seemed to be playing a game with the little wood men. They would circle for hours, then assault one of the wood men's trees with a burst of fire. The wood men seemed adept at shielding their homes, and the great serpents did not seem to be interested in destroying the men themselves.\r\n\r\nIt reminded me of my cat, Simon, whom I had left in the care of a friend. Thinking of Simon reminded me that I did not know how long I had been stranded here. Was it days, weeks, years? And what had happened to the Barnacle?\r\n\r\nI was broken out of my reverie by a violent battle between two of the great serpents. Breath of fire cut swathes of light through the dark night sky, temporarily blinding me. Pools of blazing magma erupted across the ground. It must have been a territorial dispute, because the victorious serpent seemed uninterested in the charred corpse of his adversary.\r\n\r\nClutched in the burned hands I found a most curious egg.",
					"The Ordon - Molten Guardian\r\n\r\nGreat golems made of stone and fire bar my way further up the mountain. Do I dare try to pass them as I passed the bull-men before? My costume has gotten better, with twigs and brush propping up the shoulders, giving me the silhouette of a true bull-man. I daresay I could walk right in. What is the harm in trying?\r\n\r\nI clutched the egg to my chest protectively as I passed by the guardian. The blazing heat radiated off of it in waves, searing my flesh. Where was I going? I did not know. Up, I suppose.\r\n\r\nI found a smoldering kiln that may be used to create the golems. A burned-out husk lay nearby, along with a stone that appeared to blaze without ceasing. Perhaps the stone was used to imbue the creature with life? But where did such stones come from?\r\n\r\nAt that moment I was grabbed from behind, and the world went black.",
					"The Ordon - Blazebound Chanter\r\n\r\nThese bull-men, more well-dressed than their brethren and with weaponry carved with intricate runes, carried me to the great pyre at the center of their temple.\r\n\r\nI can only assume one of their religious order presided over the initial searing of my flesh. They spoke in an unknown language as they carved into my skin with white-hot daggers. A rain of burning meteors fell around us, obscuring the temple from outsiders while the bull-men performed their tortuous rituals.\r\n\r\nWhen they had finished, the chanter spoke a word of power and called forth a monster of magma and stone.\r\n\r\nI could only surmise that my soul would be formed into one of the burning stones, and used to power a lifeless automaton for all time.",
					"The Ordon - Eternal Kilnmaster\r\n\r\nThe muscular guard thrust his polearm into the ground, conjuring forth an eruption of flames that spread into my obsidian cell. I ceased my wails for a short time.\r\n\r\nI did not know what they planned to do to me, but I did know that my journey had come to an end. Despite myself, my curiosity firmly took hold, and I continued to watch them in earnest.\r\n\r\nI noticed that then these hulking bull-men came close to their campfire, a cauldron of flames, they seemed empowered by the fire. But I could not think of a way to use this to my advantage, and crumpled into a heap in the corner of my cell to await my fate.",
					'The Ordon - High Priest\r\n\r\nI was brought to the center of the bull-men\'s great temple once again. Before me stood an imposing figure, a bull-man that radiated such power that I nearly had to close my eyes, lest I be blinded. His hands were charred black, and fur similarly burned in places.\r\n\r\nI was led to a great cauldron. In their guttural speech, the word "Ordos" rang out several times with obvious reverence. In the distance, a great figure approached, his mane an ever-burning inferno, his eyes weeping tears of molten magma. A spear in the back pushed me ever closer to the cauldron in front of me.\r\n\r\nIn desperation, I flung the serpent egg into the cauldron. It was my last, and only, resort. The egg burst open, and a small serpent emerged, shook itself, and rapidly began to ascend.\r\n\r\nI leapt, grabbing the tail of the creature as it flew high into the sky. But I could not hold on for long, and soon I found myself plunging into the cold, dark waters far below.',
					"Inside the Great Evermaw\r\n\r\nAs the icy waves closed around me, I found myself swept up in a powerful current and deposited into a rank hollow.\r\n\r\nMy surroundings became lit for but a moment as the cavern behind me opened to allow a fresh rush of sea water, and it was then that I realized that I had been swallowed by a great fish.\r\n\r\nBefore the maw closed again, I took note of my surroundings. The smooth, muscled walls stretched far back into the distance. Deposits of flotsam and jetsam had become lodged in various locations - from the wreckage of ships small and large to the picked-over bones of strange undersea creatures.\r\n\r\nFar back in the cavern, I saw a faint light. For some reason, it reminded me of the soothing whispers I had heard on the misty northwestern shore. And thus I found the lantern - a dull, rusted thing, but somehow comforting.\r\n\r\nAnd so here I sit, writing an end to my tale that none will hear.",
					"Final Entry\r\n\r\nIt has found me! No, no no, I have found it! Yes! It was meant to be, this is where I was always meant to be, a portal to the future, to my future.\r\n\r\nThe lantern illuminates my scrawling, it helps me find the way. Vazuvius calls.\r\n\r\nAnd so I will answer. I will light the lantern and plunge my head into the stagnant waters, and breathe deep the salty air of my brethren.\r\n\r\nAND I WILL JOIN THE DREAD CREW IN ETERNAL PLUNDER.",

					"The chief warden of the internment camps, Aedelas Blackmoore, watched over the captive orcs from his prison-stronghold, Durnholde. One orc in particular had always held his interest: the orphaned infant he had found nearly eighteen years before. Blackmoore had raised the young male as a favored slave and named him Thrall. Blackmoore taught the orc about tactics, philosophy, and combat. Thrall was even trained as a gladiator. All the while, the corrupt warden sought to mold the orc into a weapon.",
					"Despite his harsh upbringing, young Thrall grew into a strong, quick-witted orc, and he knew in his heart that a slave's life was not for him. As he grew to maturity, he learned about his people, the orcs, whom he had never met: after their defeat, most of them had been placed in internment camps. Rumor had it that Doomhammer, the orc leader, had escaped from Lordaeron and gone into hiding. Only one rogue clan still operated in secret, trying to evade the watchful eyes of the Alliance.",
					"The resourceful yet inexperienced Thrall decided to escape from Blackmoore's fortress and set off to find others of his kind. During his journeys Thrall visited the internment camps and found his once-mighty race to be strangely cowed and lethargic. Having not found the proud warriors he hoped to discover, Thrall set out to find the last undefeated orc chieftain, Grom Hellscream.",
					"Constantly hunted by the humans, Hellscream nevertheless held onto the Horde's unquenchable will to fight. Aided only by his own devoted Warsong clan, Hellscream continued to wage an underground war against the oppression of his beleaguered people. Unfortunately, Hellscream could never find a way to rouse the captured orcs from their stupor. The impressionable Thrall, inspired by Hellscream's idealism, developed a strong empathy for the Horde and its warrior traditions.",
					"Seeking the truth of his own origins, Thrall traveled north to find the legendary Frostwolf clan. Thrall learned that Gul'dan had exiled the Frostwolves during the early days of the First War. He also discovered that he was the son and heir of the orc hero Durotan, the true chieftain of the Frostwolves who had been murdered in the wilds nearly twenty years before.",
					"Under the tutelage of the venerable shaman Drek'Thar, Thrall studied his people's ancient shamanistic culture, which had been forgotten under Gul'dan's evil rule. Over time, Thrall became a powerful shaman and took his rightful place as chieftain of the exiled Frostwolves. Empowered by the elements themselves and driven to find his destiny, Thrall set off to free the captive clans and heal his race of demonic corruption.",
					"During his travels, Thrall found the aged warchief, Orgrim Doomhammer, who had been living as a hermit for many years. Doomhammer, who had been a close friend of Thrall's father, decided to follow the young, visionary orc and help him free the captive clans. Supported by many of the veteran chieftains, Thrall ultimately succeeded in revitalizing the Horde and giving his people a new spiritual identity.",
					"To symbolize his people's rebirth, Thrall returned to Blackmoore's fortress of Durnholde and put a decisive end to his former master's plans by laying siege to the internment camps. This victory was not without its price: during the liberation of one camp, Doomhammer fell in battle.",
					"Thrall took up Doomhammer's legendary warhammer and donned his black plate-armor to become the new warchief of the Horde. During the following months, Thrall's small but volatile Horde laid waste to the internment camps and stymied the Alliance's best efforts to counter his clever strategies. Encouraged by his best friend and mentor, Grom Hellscream, Thrall worked to ensure that his people would never be slaves again.",

The name alone is enough to chill the hearts of the living. Few weapons have shaped as much of modern history as this one. Frostmourne spilled the blood of kings and destroyed nations. The scars it inflicted on the world remain to this day.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIcebringer and Frostreaper will always carry this history with them, but they will not follow in Frostmourne\'s path. They will make their own future. As one legacy ends, so another begins.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Blades of the Fallen Prince, Part One</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe tales of Frostmourne are many, but they all trace back to the Lich King. The Burning Legion molded this spectral entity for one purpose: to spread a plague of undeath across Azeroth. Deep within the trackless wastes of Northrend, the Lich King began this dark task. His influence crept over the world like a shadow and manipulated mortal minds to serve him as agents of undeath.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe Lich King also possessed otherworldly artifacts to achieve his goal. Among them was the demon-forged runeblade Frostmourne. The weapon could consume the souls of its victims, imprisoning their spirits within the blade. It could also remake the living into mindless undead servants. Yet to harness these extraordinary powers, the Lich King required a mortal vessel to wield Frostmourne.\r\n<BR/><BR/>In the young human prince Arthas Menethil, he would find such a vessel.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Blades of the Fallen Prince, Part Two</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nLordaeron was the first region crippled by the plague of undeath. The affliction claimed entire families and villages as it tore through the human kingdom. The victims found no peace in death. They rose from the grave as mindless undead creatures called the Scourge.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nPrince Arthas Menethil vowed to stop these horrors at any cost. He undertook ever more extreme measures in pursuit of this goal. Eventually, against the wishes of his closest allies, he embarked on a reckless search for the plague\'s source in Northrend.\r\n<BR/><BR/>There, fate led him to Frostmourne. Though Arthas knew the runeblade was cursed, he believed he could use its powers for good. He was wrong. Upon taking up Frostmourne, Arthas succumbed to the Lich King\'s iron will. The prince\'s sanity unraveled, and the runeblade gorged on his soul.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nHe became the first of the Lich King\'s death knights.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Blades of the Fallen Prince, Part Three</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nFrom the journal of Captain Falric, royal guard to Prince Arthas Menethil:\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"There is something unsettling about Frostmourne. Something cold tugs at my heart whenever I am near the weapon. But I cannot deny its power. No one can. Not after this last battle. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"Arthas led us into the stronghold of that unholy creature called Mal\'Ganis. We could barely keep up with the prince. He never seemed to tire. Never seemed afraid. With that strange blade in his hand, he ripped through the undead. Even Mal\'Ganis stood no chance against the prince.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"A great victory, but I am in no mood to celebrate. Arthas has been acting strange of late. After the battle, he disappeared into the icy wastes. For what reason, I cannot say. I will soon go to find him."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Blades of the Fallen Prince, Part Four</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nFrom chapter three of The Fall of Lordaeron and the Scouring of the Eastweald, written by Royal Historian Archesonus:\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"Prince Arthas returned from Northrend to a hero\'s welcome. Bells tolled as the people of Lordaeron cheered their beloved prince. No one knew that he had lost his soul to Frostmourne. No one knew that he had slain his own soldiers in Northrend and converted them into undead.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"In the capital city\'s throne room, Arthas knelt before his father and liege, King Terenas II. It was to be a reunion of joy, but it ended in tragedy.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"The prince plunged Frostmourne through his father\'s heart. The blade drained Terenas\'s soul, as it would do to many others. With one stroke of the cursed weapon, Arthas destroyed more than a king. He destroyed an entire nation. All of Lordaeron soon fell to the dark prince and his Scourge."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Blades of the Fallen Prince, Part Five</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAs Arthas and the Scourge swept over Lordaeron, panic seized the living. Though many humans gave in to despair, some looked to the holy paladins for salvation. Uther the Lightbringer was the greatest of these righteous warriors. If anyone had the power to stop the fallen prince, it was him.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIn the city of Andorhal, the two met in a battle that would decide Lordaeron\'s fate. Frostmourne clashed with Uther\'s legendary Hammer of the Lightbringer. Each weapon blow erupted in a shower of warring energies. It was a struggle between Light and darkness, between life and death.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nDeath prevailed. Frostmourne cleaved through Uther\'s gilded armor and devoured his virtuous soul. And with that, Arthas extinguished the last ray of hope that remained for Lordaeron\'s people.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Blades of the Fallen Prince, Part Six</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe list of Frostmourne\'s victims is long. Nearly everyone killed by the runeblade suffered the same dark fate. The weapon feasted on their broken souls and locked them within Frostmourne itself.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nRanger-General Sylvanas Windrunner was an exception. When the Scourge invaded the high elf kingdom of Quel\'Thalas, she led a fierce resistance. Her brilliant tactics stymied Arthas and his unholy forces at every turn. She fought with the courage and valor of a true hero.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nWhen at last Sylvanas fell in battle, she did not receive the hero\'s death she deserved. Arthas punished the ranger-general for her stubborn opposition. He used Frostmourne to rip Sylvanas\'s soul from her body, and then he transformed her spirit into an incorporeal banshee.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Blades of the Fallen Prince, Part Seven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe death of the high elf king Anasterian Sunstrider, as recounted by Magister Hathorel:\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"That rabid dog Arthas came to Quel\'Thalas for one reason: to steal the power of our glorious Sunwell. We did everything to stop him. Everything. And still Arthas and his foul army marched on.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"It was in those final moments that our great king, Anasterian, appeared. He bore the legendary blade Felo\'melorn. Dead and living alike stopped and watched as Anasterian dueled Arthas. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"Old though he was, my king held his own. He pushed Arthas to his limits. But even Felo\'melorn was no match for Frostmourne. Arthas cleaved Anasterian\'s ancient blade in two. Then, with a single ruthless strike, the death knight ran my king through.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"I wanted to fight on, but I knew in my heart that it was all over. Everyone did."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Blades of the Fallen Prince, Part Eight</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nNot even the mighty Sapphiron was safe from Frostmourne\'s bite. This wise blue dragon was a master of arcane magic and one of the greatest of his kind who had ever lived. For many ages, he and his loyal draconic servants stood guard over a trove of extraordinary relics in Northrend. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIt was these relics that drew Arthas\'s attention to Sapphiron. The death knight and his Scourge minions invaded the dragon\'s lair to pilfer its treasures. The battle that followed would become one of legend. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Sapphiron and his fellow dragons unleashed the full fury of their arcane might on Arthas, but he would not be denied his prize. The death knight overwhelmed his ancient foes and slew them one by one. Calling on Frostmourne\'s powers, Arthas then transformed Sapphiron into an undead frost wyrm.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIn his new form, Sapphiron would become one of the Scourge\'s most terrifying weapons.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Blades of the Fallen Prince, Part Nine</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nFew crossed blades with Arthas and lived to tell the tale, but the demon Illidan Stormrage was one of them.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nWith a mighty army at his back, Illidan stormed across Northrend to destroy the Lich King. He advanced through sleet and snow toward Icecrown Citadel, frozen capital of the Scourge. Upon finally reaching his destination, Illidan found the death knight Arthas and the undead barring his way.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAs living and dead waged war upon each other, Illidan and Arthas grappled in single combat. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Armed with the mighty Warglaives of Azzinoth, Illidan assailed the death knight from all sides. The keening of their blades splintered the ice and shook the halls of the Lich King\'s citadel. Though evenly matched, Arthas gained the upper hand. Frostmourne tore through Illidan\'s flesh, nearly killing him.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe demon escaped with his life, but his wound would never truly heal. Years later, it would still ache from Frostmourne\'s icy touch.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Blades of the Fallen Prince, Part Ten</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nWith Illidan defeated and his army routed, Arthas took the final step to seal his damnation. He became one with the Lich King, his mind and soul merging with the powerful spectral entity. In that moment, Arthas the death knight was no more. He became the avatar of death itself.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nArthas had bested all of his adversaries, and now his powers had increased by orders of magnitude. It seemed that none could stand against this new Lich King, but there was one who did. His name was Tirion Fordring, and he wielded a holy blade known as the Ashbringer. \r\n<BR/><BR/>At the Second Battle for Light\'s Hope Chapel, Tirion confronted Arthas and showed the world that he was not invincible. With a mighty blow from the Ashbringer, he forced the Scourge ruler to retreat. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIt was not the last time Frostmourne would clash with the Ashbringer. When next the two blades met, only one would remain unbroken.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Blades of the Fallen Prince, Part Eleven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nNo king rules forever. Atop Icecrown Citadel, Arthas would learn that lesson.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nTo destroy the Lich King and his Scourge once and for all, Azeroth\'s nations launched a massive campaign into Northrend. The bloody war culminated in a siege on Icecrown Citadel itself. Armed with the Ashbringer, Tirion Fordring led some of the world\'s greatest champions deep into the stronghold. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIn the frenzied assault that followed, Tirion once again met Arthas in battle. The Ashbringer crashed against Frostmourne, steel howling like a bitter winter wind. After a single bone-shaking strike, Tirion did what so many other great heroes had failed to do. He shattered Frostmourne. He ended Arthas\'s reign.\r\n<BR/><BR/>The breaking of Frostmourne unleashed many of the souls trapped within the runeblade. It also freed Arthas from the sword\'s domination. According to Tirion Fordring, the fallen prince\'s last words were: \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"I see... only darkness... before me..."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

					"The Old Wizard's Almanac: The Alliance\r\n\r\nAs a historically Alliance-friendly organization, one would think that the Kirin Tor might not need a guidebook outlining the Alliance races.  I feel that the opposite is true - that we can only understand the other races after truly looking inward.  - O.W.\r\n",
					"Human - As adaptable a race as you will ever find, humans can be some of the most highly skilled magic-users.  Any list of the most powerful mages in history will be dominated by humans.  Perhaps most tellingly, the Old Wizard himself is a human.\r\n\r\nDwarf - Dwarves possess a moderate magical acuity, but tend to have difficulty at the higher echelons of wizardry.  While they tend to focus more on priestly endeavors, a rare few have been known to dabble in arcane or necromantic activities.\r\n",
					"Gnome - Gnomes are remarkably adept arcanists.  Pound for pound, they are some of the most potent casters the world has ever known, and have always had a presence in the Kirin Tor.\r\n\r\nNight Elf - While night elves tend to avoid arcane energy like it was the Scourge, their druidic powers are second to none.",
					"Draenei - This ancient race has brought the Alliance both powerful wizards and masterful wielders of the Light.  More recently, the Draenei have adopted shamanism after their arrival in Kalimdor.\r\n\r\nHigh Elf - The magic of the high elves is extremely powerful.  High elves possess a magical acumen that rivals that of any - even the humans.  Some of the greatest heroes in the Battle of Mount Hyjal were the High Elf priests.\r\n",
					"The Old Wizard's Almanac: The Horde\r\n\r\nUp until the last few years, most of my information on the Horde has been anecdotal, or inferred from my few experiences in battle against them.  However, as the Kirin Tor has recently adopted a more neutral stance in Horde-Alliance relations, the amount of information on the Horde and their magic has exploded. - O.W.\r\n",
					"Orc - Despite their obvious physical strength, they display a decent magical ability.  Orcs tend to make poor arcanists, but culturally have a heritage of peaceful shamanism, combined with a more recent focus on the darker magic of warlocks and necromancy.\r\n\r\nTauren - Few experiment with the arcane, but the bull-men are highly attuned to the magics of the earth.  As is the case with many nature-worshipping tribes, many follow the path of the shaman.  Furthermore, their most senior druids can rival the archdruids of Darnassus in power.\r\n",
					"Troll - A surprising affinity for the magic arts belies the trolls' barbaric reputation and history.  My Zul'tour - an expedition into the troll empires of Zul'Aman, Zul'Farrak, and Zul'Drak - has revealed a startling variety in troll casters, ranging from witch doctors to shadow priests to a bizarre animal worship that most closely resembles druidism.\r\n\r\nUndead - The undead have as much magical skill as can be expected of any living human... if not more.  Sylvanas' Forsaken, in particular, fling spells with the frightening levels of zeal.",
					'Blood Elf - A history of prolonged exposure to magical energy has left an indelible mark on the Blood Elves.  These lithe, magic-addicted creatures seem to fare well in any magical school they study.  Most recently, the blood elves have taken up the path of the "Blood Knight", which can be loosely described as a form of paladinism.\r\n\r\nTaunka - Much like their tauren cousins, taunka tend to focus on magic stemming from the earth.\r\n',
					"The Old Wizard's Almanac: Other Arcanist-Friendly Races\r\n\r\nMagic is not limited simply to the races of the Horde and the Alliance.  Many of the creatures that make Azeroth their home are capable of thaumaturgical pursuits. - O.W.\r\n",
					"Naga - While males are more suited for melee combat, female naga are incredible sorcerers, commanding the power of water and ice at their fingertips.  It should be noted that their ancient queen Azshara was reputedly one of the most powerful magic-users in Azeroth's history.\r\n\r\nNerubian - Only the most powerful Nerubian leaders have the capacity for magic.  However, following the onslaught of the Scourge, many plagued Nerubians have become necromancers.\r\n",
					"Ogre - Most of these expatriates from Draenor focus on the path of the warrior or the ranger, but a small percentage choose a life of sorcery as ogre-magi.  Cho'gall, one of the first ogre-magi, was an immensely powerful sorcerer (in addition to simply being immense).\r\n\r\nSatyr - These dangerous creatures have features similar to those of night elves, but twisted demonic bodies. Masters of demonic magic, satyrs are incredibly dangerous. Extreme caution is advised when approaching them.",
					"Blue Dragons - The ancient children of Malygos are among the foremost experts on arcane magic. Some, such as the adventurous Kalecgos, are friendly to the mortal wizard and potentially could make excellent research partners. Unfortunately, recent rumors from the north indicate that some blue dragons have grown extremely hostile to other spellcasters. The reasons for this aggression are as-yet unknown.\r\n",
					"The Old Wizard's Almanac: The Shamanic Races\r\n\r\nMy travels have introduced me to numerous societies across Azeroth, many of whom practice shamanism.  Many of these peoples live off the land, shunning advanced society for a more nature-centric existence. - O.W.\r\n",
					"Quilboar - The few quilboar that remain in Kalimdor are known to practice geomancy, a crude form of shamanism.  Some plagued quilboar practice this form of magic even in undeath.\r\n\r\nGnoll - Gnolls are a strange race.  I once managed to gain the favor of a clan leader in Redridge by performing a basic cantrip - the kind taught to Dalaran's schoolchildren.  For a day, he was my best friend, until he forgot my trick and sicced his hunters on me.  Anyhow, when they can be bothered to pay attention long enough, gnolls tend to focus on elemental shamanism.\r\n",
					"Centaur - Centaur females tend to use a dark, perverted form of shamanism.  Magic use among centaur males, on the other hand, is quite rare.\r\n\r\nWolvar - This wolverine-like group may appear primitive upon first glance.  However, their tribal leaders are often very powerful shaman.\r\n",
					"Oracles - Though they are the sworn enemies of the wolvar, the oracles seem to have a nearly identical social system.  Grunt work is done by warriors, but their cultural leaders are nearly always great shamanic practitioners.\r\n\r\nFurbolg - These days, it seems few furbolg ever become shaman.  Shamanism is much more common among the free-willed furbolg tribes.  Furthermore, some free-willed furbolg are even capable of basic shapeshifting, much like a trained druid.\r\n",
					"The Old Wizard's Almanac: Peoples of the Land\r\n\r\nShamanism isn't the only nature-centric magic.  Many of Azeroth's simpler races perform spells that stem from the the earth's energies, but which cannot be called shamanism.  Whether their magic powers come from the same source as the shaman's magic or not is a constant point of debate in the halls of the Violet Citadel. - O.W.",
					"Tuskarr - The walrus-men practice a form of magic that, on its surface, is astonishingly similar to shamanism.  Our scholars have not yet deciphered the source of the tuskarr's magic.\r\n\r\nKobold - These simple creatures are only capable of simple earth magic.  My exploits as a youth taught me that a few of them have perfected a rather nasty fireball, but that's about it.\r\n",
					"Wildkin - These feathered creatures go by many names - moonkin, owlbear, and owlkin, to name a few.  These gentle giants possess a natural, druidic energy similar to that of the night elves.\r\n\r\nHarpy - The cackling bird-women are capable of powerful elemental storm magic.  Little is known about the source of their power, as 1) they attack invaders on sight, 2) few can discern any meaning behind their shrill cries, and 3) none can tolerate the smell of their nests.\r\n",
					"Murloc - For many years these enigmatic creatures appeared to be capable of only the most basic magic.  Do not be deceived by their unintelligent fae.  The fish-men are fully capable of casting potent earth and water spells, and their numbers on land increase by the day.\r\n\r\nMakrura - The lobster-like race of makrura, while widely considered to be primitive, has an innate capacity for water magic.\r\n",
					"The Old Wizard's Almanac: Non-Magical Creatures\r\n\r\nMagic isn't for everyone.  The non-intelligent beasts of the world have survived for millennia on their wits alone, as have several of the simpler races.  Some races, while socially advanced, simply prefer to avoid magic in favor of other pursuits.  As Kirin Tor, it is critically important that we understand the way that these races thrive without any magic at all. - O.W.\r\n",
					"Goblin - Goblins tend to be distrustful of magic, preferring to focus mainly on technological ventures.  Unlike their gnomish counterparts, they lack the capacity to understand and appreciate the arcane.  That being said, there are some that have combined their technology with magic, yielding interesting results.\r\n\r\nTrogg - These primitive creatures simply lack the intelligence necessary for magic.\r\n",
					'Magnataur - The enormous magnataur have little to no magical affinity.  Magnataur casters are very rare, and tend to be follow a shamanic route if they practice magic at all.  I can tell you first-hand, however, that they won\'t go down without a fight, and their thick hides can withstand several of the most powerful frostbolts.\r\n\r\nVrykul - While Northrend\'s half-giants naturally know little to no magic, some have been trained in necromancy by the Lich King. I have also heard rumors of "rune magic" of some kind, but I have not yet had the opportunity to research this intriguing subject in depth.',

As tools of assassination, they are unparalleled. And every moment of every day that you carry them, they will seek to bend your mind to the will of their master, Kil\'jaeden. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nPerhaps one day you will be able to thank him personally for that.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Kingslayers, Part One</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThese daggers were forged to spill the blood of heroes and innocents. In the hands of Garona Halforcen, they did just that. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAnguish and Sorrow were named well. In their history, they have killed kings, commanders, soldiers, magi, demons, and countless others. If things had gone a little differently, it might have been these weapons that allowed the first Horde to conquer Azeroth. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe story of these daggers begins on Draenor, soon after the Burning Legion had sunk its claws into the orc clans.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Kingslayers, Part Two</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nIn the early days of the Horde, Gul\'dan had taken Garona under his care. As a half-orc, half-draenei outcast, Garona had found survival to be brutally difficult since she was born. She had learned quickly how to avoid unwinnable fights, and how to quietly kill relentless pursuers. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nGul\'dan bound her mind to his will and began to secretly train her in the art of assassination. She did not fully understand his intentions, but she grew to resent his cruelty. Still, she obeyed. Survival demanded nothing less.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nGarona proved to be skilled with almost any weapon she held, but Gul\'dan was not satisfied. His grip on the Horde was still tenuous; assassinating his enemies could backfire if the involvement of his Shadow Council became known. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nHe needed weapons that would allow Garona to kill for him with impunity.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Kingslayers, Part Three</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe Horde\'s first warchief held the solution to Gul\'dan\'s problem. Warchief Blackhand and his clan, the Blackrocks, had the most advanced weapon foundries among all the orcs of Draenor. Gul\'dan approached them quietly, asking how their ancestors had created the powerful, legendary weapon of Doomhammer.\r\n<BR/><BR/> \r\n"It was a gift from the fiery heart of Draenor," they told him.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThat was no help. Gul\'dan wanted to break the orcs\' reverence of the elements; asking the Furies of Draenor for more weapons might strengthen it instead. Gul\'dan turned to Kil\'jaeden for assistance, imploring the Burning Legion for aid.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nKil\'jaeden saw the value of having a covert assassin at the Shadow Council\'s command. He gave Gul\'dan strict instructions... and the raw materials needed to create two of the deadliest weapons Draenor would ever know.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Kingslayers, Part Four</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nWarchief Blackhand was intrigued by Gul\'dan\'s request. The warlock had asked for two daggers created from a mysterious type of ore that no orc had ever seen before, and he wanted them imbued with a power that would only reveal itself when the time was right. Blackhand agreed to make the weapons himself in his foundry.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAs Blackhand quenched the blades, he felt a terrible, dark presence fill them with unspeakable might. This was no Elemental Fury-it was the raw hatred of Kil\'jaeden sinking deep within the daggers. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBlackhand could feel untamed agony radiating from the weapons. He named them Anguish and Sorrow, for he knew they would never be satisfied unless they were drinking the blood of new victims. \r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Kingslayers, Part Five</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nGul\'dan was delighted with the daggers\' power. Not only were they brimming with the dark presence of a Burning Legion lord, but they also were imbued with the means to control the will of the one who wielded them.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nTo test the weapons\' potential, Gul\'dan handed them to Garona and gave her a simple command. She obeyed instantly. An unfortunate Shadow Council acolyte had no chance to defend himself before she tore open his throat with one slash. \r\n<BR/><BR/>It was not a pleasant death. But it was fast, quiet, and efficient. When the orc took his last breath, the wound that killed him became irregular. Nobody would be able to tell whether he had died to a knife, an axe, or a spear. Gul\'dan saw the possibilities immediately. A mysterious death could be used to sow confusion and redirect suspicion wherever he pleased. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThese daggers would prove to be extremely valuable.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Kingslayers, Part Six</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAs the Horde waged war on the draenei, Gul\'dan dispatched Garona with care and precision. Influential orcs who expressed doubt or dissent were often found dead shortly after a skirmish with draenei forces. The wounds did not look as if they had come from orcish weapons, so Gul\'dan was never suspected. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nNor was Garona. As a "half-breed," she lived beneath the notice of most orcs, and those who noticed her saw only a servant of Gul\'dan, held on a tight leash. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nHer quiet work aided the Horde in securing victory against the draenei, and then her blades helped maintain control in the war\'s aftermath. Life on Draenor withered due to the presence of fel magic, but tensions within the Horde stayed manageable. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nWhenever they didn\'t, Gul\'dan gave the command, and Garona obeyed. Her daggers were busy.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Kingslayers, Part Seven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nFor many years, Garona was bound to the will of the Shadow Council. She obeyed them to survive; she killed on their behalf to appease them. She often dreamed of using these daggers to slay her masters, but when she woke, her ensorcelled mind buried those thoughts, keeping her loyal.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThat power, fortunately, seems to have died decades ago, along with Gul\'dan in the Tomb of Sargeras. And to be clear, nobody is happier to see these daggers exacting payback from the Burning Legion than Garona.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Kingslayers, Part Eight</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nWhen the Horde invaded Azeroth, Gul\'dan ordered Garona to find the sorcerer Medivh and keep an eye on him. In time, Garona would reveal herself to Khadgar, seeing humans as a potential means of escaping Gul\'dan. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nHad she known that these daggers helped the warlock control her actions, she might have abandoned them, and history would have gone down a very different path. In the end, though she tried to resist, Gul\'dan manipulated her into murdering the king of Stormwind, Llane Wrynn.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nGarona was now considered a traitor. She was forced to return to the Horde, bringing these daggers back with her.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Kingslayers, Part Nine</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nGarona did not receive a hero\'s welcome from the Horde. Warchief Blackhand had been killed by Orgrim Doomhammer in a mak\'gora. Gul\'dan was in a coma, and his Shadow Council was on the run. Garona was tortured for information on the Shadow Council\'s location.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAs the Horde moved to finish off the human-led Alliance, Garona made her escape. With only these weapons and her survival instincts, she set out across Azeroth to find a new life. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe poor Horde trackers sent to hunt her down never really had a chance.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Kingslayers, Part Ten</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nEventually, as Garona was pulled into the events of the Second War, she began to understand the power these daggers were exerting on her will. Even so far away, she could feel Gul\'dan trying to compel her back into his clutches.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nShe sought out the help of an undead mage named Meryl Winterstorm, asking him to hide the blades somewhere beyond anyone\'s reach. Garona wanted to make sure that no other victim would die to them, and that no other mind would be subject to Gul\'dan\'s tricks.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThese daggers remained buried for decades.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Kingslayers, Part Eleven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThese weapons do not have a history of glory. They did not earn honorable victories. They were meant to cause pain, and they have caused untold damage to both Draenor and Azeroth.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nRespect their power. Never forget the innocents who have died to them. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nMake the Burning Legion pay for every drop of blood their wielder was forced to spill.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<IMG src="Interface\\Pictures\\artifactbook-rogue-dreadblades" align="center"/>\r\n<IMG src="Interface\\Common\\spacer" align="center" width="1" height="170"/>\r\n<H3 align="center">The Dreadblades</H3>\r\n<BR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAs you probably guessed, these cutlasses were not forged on Azeroth. Be very careful with them. They were designed to trap weak, greedy minds. Though their master was sent back to the Twisting Nether, he may try to return and influence you in the future. Stay vigilant.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Dreadblades, Part One</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe Bloodsail Buccaneers surely had no idea, at first, that they were meddling with the Burning Legion. By the end, it seems they assumed they had snatched a piece of forbidden power from under the demons\' noses. But if they believed there would be no consequences for their "gift," they were tragically mistaken.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIt was not happenstance that these weapons fell into Admiral Goreblade\'s possession. It was planned and carefully executed by a Burning Legion commander who had plenty of experience corrupting fools and turning them against their own worlds. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThese cutlasses were meant to do that here, on Azeroth.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Dreadblades, Part Two</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe eredar who created these cutlasses is named Talgath. It\'s impossible to say for certain when he first began to study Azeroth and its inhabitants, but it is certainly no accident that he crafted a pair of weapons that caught the eye of a pirate crew leader.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nTalgath\'s role in the Burning Legion is to help Kil\'jaeden corrupt the native populations of different worlds. He has brought down countless civilizations, and he knows how to tempt mortal hearts. Sometimes he has found heroic champions who could be turned, but very often he has discovered willing minds among those who live on a world\'s fringes.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Dreadblades, Part Three</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nTalgath stumbled upon an effective method of corruption: find the selfish, the greedy, and the ruthless... and make them compete for power. Not only would he learn which among them were the strongest, but the "winners" would struggle so hard to obtain their prize that they would be unwilling to question its true cost until it was too late. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAzeroth\'s pirates must have immediately seemed vulnerable to this tactic. They raided one another in search of treasure, giving little thought to the risks they would undertake.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe choice to create a pair of nimble cutlasses, the sort of weapons favored on the high seas, meant Talgath saw great potential in corrupting pirates to the Burning Legion\'s cause.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Dreadblades, Part Four</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThese weapons first showed up on Azeroth a few decades ago. Several Alliance ships reported that they had escaped a band of pirates whose leader carried glowing blades oozing black smoke, and soon it became clear that those ships were the lucky ones. A newly empowered crew of pirates was preying on Alliance vessels, and when the raiders captured a ship, they left no survivors.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nGrand Admiral Daelin Proudmoore led the search for the rogues, and after weeks of hunting, his small fleet cornered their ship a few miles off the Eastern Kingdoms\' shores. The pirate crew seemed to be possessed, barely human, but after a coordinated cannon barrage, Proudmoore sent their vessel, the Bellwether, to the bottom of the ocean.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe admiral sailed away, believing he had killed them all. In truth, one had survived.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Dreadblades, Part Five</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe single person who swam away from the sunken Bellwether was a teenage boy, a young pirate recruit who had seen his crew descend into corruption and madness firsthand. He had joined them for profit, so watching his captain and shipmates succumb to uncontrollable bloodlust had been a truly horrific experience.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nHe was compelled to retrieve these cutlasses from the ship\'s wreckage, but when he heard them whispering in his mind, he had the good sense to resist. He took the weapons and the treasure back to his crew\'s old lair and buried them deep underneath an isolated island. He believed the riches were cursed, and so he left them behind.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe weapons would remain buried for years. \r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Dreadblades, Part Six</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nIt took the upheaval of the Cataclysm to unearth these cutlasses again. A ship carrying some Bloodsail Buccaneers, a small but dangerous pirate crew, took shelter near a patch of tiny islands as the seas heaved to and fro. After the initial elemental unrest passed, their leader, Admiral Eliza Goreblade, noticed that rogue waves had revealed something beneath the sand.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nWhen they looked closer, they found a cache of gold, jewels, and old weapons. It was the last stash of the Bellwether, a windfall nobody knew had been missing.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe buccaneers gleefully took it all. Admiral Goreblade reserved a pair of gleaming cutlasses for herself, the only weapons in the cache that hadn\'t become rusted and worn over time. Unfortunately, that decision led her crew to ruin.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Dreadblades, Part Seven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAfter claiming these cutlasses, Goreblade was taken by a vision. She saw herself commanding an impossibly large pirate fleet, one that could conquer the high seas and all the nations of Azeroth. Every ship that dared to challenge her burned, and every city gave up its treasures or was destroyed.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIt was an intoxicating sight, and she drank every drop of its promise. When she awoke, she had her crew set sail for a rival pirate hideout. The corrupted Bloodsail Buccaneers proceeded to slaughter all the unfortunate souls they found there.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe loot they took was secondary. The killing was what truly satisfied them. These weapons had taken root deep within their minds, and now there was no escape.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Dreadblades, Part Eight</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nGoreblade\'s buccaneers became an unseen, deadly menace on the South Seas. The master of these weapons, Talgath, had seen what attracting too much attention would do, so he encouraged Admiral Goreblade to attack only isolated ships and make certain they did not escape. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nFor several years, the pirate crew did exactly what they were told. They killed without mercy, and the power of the cutlasses grew ever stronger. When other Bloodsail Buccaneers learned how deep into insanity this crew had fallen, they tried to intervene. Goreblade\'s pirates survived the counterattack and managed to steal the Bloodsail Buccaneers\' most prized ship, the Crimson Veil, for themselves.\r\n<BR/><BR/>Soon, some crew members began to change. Their forms withered and faded. Only their skeletons remained. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAdmiral Goreblade did not mind. The cutlasses hungered for blood, and now, so did she.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Dreadblades, Part Nine</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nShortly before the Legion\'s recent arrival, Admiral Goreblade finally discovered the true power behind her weapons. Talgath revealed himself and told her that she had only tasted a meaningless drop of the Burning Legion\'s strength. If she aided the demons in the coming war, he promised that she would ascend to immortality and find out what might the Legion could truly bestow.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe admiral agreed immediately. She made a pact, giving the souls of all her crew to Talgath\'s tender care.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nShe had already come to enjoy being the unseen terror of the seas. The possibility of bringing a world to ruin consumed her mind.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Dreadblades, Part Ten</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nWhen the Legion attacked, so did Admiral Goreblade. It now seems clear that several convoys of reinforcements--from both the Horde and the Alliance--were destroyed by her crew before they could reach the Broken Isles.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIt is fortunate that the Bloodsail Buccaneers\' true leader, Fleet Admiral Tethys, sought help. Had she been left unchecked, there is no telling what more damage Goreblade could have done to the Legion\'s enemies.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAt least that threat is over.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

No. These are fangs, ancient yet well preserved, taken from the maw of a slain felhound. This creature was more dangerous than any of its like that we\'ve ever seen. Indeed, it seems that this particular hound was the pet of the Great Enemy, Sargeras.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nHe must have cared deeply for this hound--in his own way--for he sculpted its power, gifting its sharp teeth with enough shadow energy to pierce reality itself. How many terrified innocents died to these fangs? We may never know. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut we do know this creature\'s name. Sargeras called it Goremaw the Devourer.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fangs of the Devourer, Part Two</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nWhen the Legion invaded a new world, Goremaw would often accompany them, tearing enemy soldiers to shreds. Between battles, the felhound\'s eredar caretakers would collect the shadow energy dripping from its fangs, using it to craft powerful new weapons and reagents.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nGoremaw\'s end came on an unremarkable world. It had already been pacified, its leaders corrupted and its heroes slain. A child, burning with righteous fury for his dying world, crept into the Legion\'s stronghold and killed several eredar guards--and Goremaw--while they rested. When Sargeras saw his slain hound, he was consumed with rage. That world, and all who lived upon it, was scattered as ashes in the Great Dark. Such a quick death was perhaps a small mercy for them.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut though Goremaw had died, its usefulness to the Legion had not ended.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fangs of the Devourer, Part Three</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nA dreadlord, Mephistroth, believed that Goremaw could still serve the Legion. He extracted the felhound\'s fangs and took them to a great demon forge on the eredar homeworld of Argus. There were many challenges in preserving the fangs\' dark energies. Mephistroth dared not handle the task himself. His subordinates were eager to distinguish themselves, even at great risk. But the fangs\' twisted power often proved too dangerous. When it pierced their minds and inflicted unspeakable agony, the dreadlord simply discarded them, giving their souls to the demon forge and finding another servant to take their place.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut in the end, their work was successful. The fangs had been sharpened to a permanent edge, their shadow powers preserved for all time.\r\n<BR/><BR/>Mephistroth had created two of the deadliest weapons the universe had ever known. These daggers could twist the air and bend light, allowing their wielders to conceal themselves effortlessly. He presented the daggers to Sargeras, who was greatly pleased. Goremaw had been a terror on the battlefield; in the hands of a skilled assassin, its fangs would be a terror in the shadows.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fangs of the Devourer, Part Four</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nIt took time for Sargeras to find someone worthy of wielding the Fangs of the Devourer. Loyalty was a concern. Skilled assassins are deceptive by nature, all too capable of betrayal. Sargeras would not abide the thought of Goremaw\'s legacy falling into the hands of the Legion\'s enemies.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nConsider that for a moment: using these weapons against the Legion will be a personal affront to the Legion\'s lord.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fangs of the Devourer, Part Five</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nFinally, Sargeras found someone suitable to carry these daggers into battle. An eredar tracker named Akaari had distinguished herself in several Legion invasions, silently murdering those who suspected that the demons\' promises were laced with doom. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nShe was summoned to Argus and told of the great honor being offered to her. Sargeras promised Akaari that she would become a fearsome instrument of death, one of the deadliest creatures alive in any known realm. The price? Akaari would need to give up her will. If she wanted to be this living weapon, betrayal would become impossible. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIt was a grim bargain, but Akaari accepted it.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fangs of the Devourer, Part Six</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThere are dark places beneath the surface of Argus. In these secret chambers, weapons are forged and wills are broken. Akaari spent centuries down there, her essence being shaped and molded, intertwined with the daggers\' power. The souls of other eredar assassins were sacrificed and bound to hers, granting her the experience of a hundred lifetimes and thousands of kills.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nJust as Goremaw had been changed, so was she. She emerged from those chambers a remorseless construct of death, perfectly obedient to Sargeras. He knew that the daggers were safe in her hands, because her hands were an extension of his will. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAnd in her hands, the daggers spelled doom for those who opposed the Burning Legion.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fangs of the Devourer, Part Seven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nSargeras had his eyes on a small, militaristic world. Its inhabitants would have fought hard against a Legion invasion. Though they would have fallen eventually to direct force, Sargeras believed they might be vulnerable to fear and paranoia. This world was Akaari\'s first mission with her newly granted powers. A test. She infiltrated its strongholds alone.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nWithin a month, the world was in chaos. Tales of an unseen assassin had spread like wildfire, and as heroes and leaders died silently, the world\'s warriors broke into factions, believing each other to blame for Akaari\'s assassinations.\r\n<BR/><BR/>When the Legion finally revealed itself, the world begged to surrender. An eternity of servitude seemed better than living in fear of daggers striking from the shadows.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAkaari had passed her test in stunning fashion. She was brought back into the ranks of the Legion to support their efforts directly.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fangs of the Devourer, Part Eight</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAkaari proved she was an indispensable ally. Her weapons allowed her to play with kings and other leaders like toys. Not only could she eliminate whom she wanted, but she could also take their place in disguise, perfectly mimicking their appearance and manner.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nA world does not fall because of a single assassin. But it certainly falls more quickly. A dagger through the right person\'s heart can win a battle or topple a kingdom. A panicked army that just lost its leader is more easily destroyed than a stalwart, determined force. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe Legion already had plenty of experience in corrupting weak minds and mortal hearts. Akaari was the demons\' proof against failure. Whenever someone had the strength or the sense to resist temptation, Akaari\'s blades handled the rest.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fangs of the Devourer, Part Nine</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nYes, Akaari was Sargeras\'s asset, loyal and unquestioning. But even though her will was gone, her guile remained. She requested that Sargeras allow her to roam the Twisting Nether for a time. He agreed, curious to see how she would further the goals of the Burning Legion. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nShe spent time skulking among the ranks of Sargeras\'s own armies, rooting out discontent and erasing ambitious demons who hoped to seize power at the Legion\'s expense. She became skilled in the art of interrogation, able to inflict untold pain and suffering upon any creature able to scream. She built a citadel on a dead world to hold prisoners and extract knowledge from them. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nOver time, her actions created malcontents within the Legion. The demons imagined her daggers in their throats, and their constant fear of her inspired thoughts of escape.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fangs of the Devourer, Part Ten</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nWhen the location of Akaari\'s citadel became known to the rest of the Legion, she made a show of abandoning it. It had become useless, an unhelpful symbol. But it had served its purpose. She would return to the citadel in time, but only in secret, and only to prepare for particularly difficult invasions or to interrogate particularly important prisoners.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nShe returned to Sargeras with new skills and a new philosophy: fear was a double-edged sword, useful, but not always the right choice. An unseen assassin inspired terror, yes, but an unknown assassin inspired complacency. An enemy could not prepare to face a danger that seemingly did not exist.\r\n<BR/><BR/>Akaari dedicated herself to becoming truly invisible. A silent killer. Her work continued.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAnd then she met her end in her most secure stronghold. It was probably not the fate she imagined for herself.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fangs of the Devourer, Part Eleven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nWe may never know what compelled Akaari to sacrifice her free will in service to Sargeras. But there can be no doubt that she served him well. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nShe embraced the intricacies of fear and knew how to strike it into the hearts of her victims. When confronting those without fear, she skillfully eliminated them. When terror became counterproductive, she learned how to kill without being noticed at all.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThese lessons were once employed by the Burning Legion. Now they belong to its enemies. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nOnly time will tell how Sargeras will respond.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

Some felt an advantage was needed to turn the tide of battle. To this end, the scythe was created, joining a fang from the wolf Ancient, Goldrinn, with the divinely empowered Staff of Elune.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

Ralaar found an unlikely ally in Arvell\'s beloved, the priestess Belysra Starbreeze.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nTogether, Ralaar and Belysra joined the fang of Goldrinn with the Staff of Elune to create the legendary Scythe of Elune... a weapon that would alter the course of history.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

Many druids turned into worgen, feral creatures that viciously attacked both friend and foe.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSo it was that the archdruid Malfurion Stormrage obtained the scythe and used it to banish Ralaar and his fellow worgen to the realm of the Emerald Dream, where he hoped they would remain pacified at the base of the majestic tree Daral\'nir.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

Thousands of years later, the scythe would be rediscovered by a night elf priestess, Velinde Starsong. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nDesperately seeking a way to overcome yet another incursion of demonic forces, Velinde channeled the scythe\'s powers to call forth the worgen from their place of banishment in the Emerald Dream.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nHowever, Velinde was unable to control the summoned worgen.

Though the wolves had wounded the tiny creature, she still fought fiercely, swiping viciously with her claws at the bigger predators. Freya was astonished to see that, before long, the wolves were driven away, unwilling to suffer further injuries for their meal.\r\n<BR/><BR/>When Freya picked up the cub, the keeper endured a flurry of small scratches for her trouble. That did not anger her. Quite the contrary. Delighted by the creature\'s unrelenting wildness, the keeper healed the cub\'s injuries and named her Ashamane, for the color of her striking black fur. \r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

Freya was pleased to see that the panther did not succumb to desires for vengeance. Ashamane could have stalked and killed every wolf in her valley. Easily. But she didn\'t. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nHer wild nature granted her understanding. Was she not a predator as well? Did she not hunt prey? The wolves had had no vendetta against Ashamane; they had been hungry. She bore no malice toward them.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut she did enjoy toying with them. The wolf pack that had attacked her would sometimes be woken from sleep by an ear-shattering roar. Ashamane would creep up to their den and announce her presence loudly, sending them fleeing. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Over time, Ashamane realized that she had become more powerful than any other panther she had ever seen. The passing years did not age her but instead made her stronger. Generations of wildlife came and went before her eyes.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThere were other animals like her.

The chaos of the wilderness, the struggle for survival--they had been the core of Ashamane\'s being. Now they were irrelevant. She had ascended above her old life. There was no prey that could evade her. There was no joy in an effortless hunt. There was no predator that could challenge her. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAshamane strode openly through the jungles of Azeroth. Other wild creatures had nothing to fear from her. Stories of a giant, majestic panther spread among the trolls who ventured into the area. Some sought to venerate her as one of their loa. Ashamane rarely let them see her. Other trolls tracked her for a different reason. Certain hunters craved the glory that would surely come from bringing down such a magnificent being. Defeating a loa... there was no greater challenge. \r\n<BR/><BR/>One by one, these ambitious trolls crept into the jungle, arrogance burning in their hearts. Ashamane was delighted. No matter how clever they were, no matter how silently they moved or how true their aim, they all returned to their tribes empty-handed, the sound of her roar still ringing in their ears, and the sight of her fangs forever haunting their dreams. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nShe did not need to take their lives.

The panther\'s heart was too unwilling to be tethered to any other creature. Freya understood, and she always smiled when she saw Ashamane\'s glowing eyes watching her from afar.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nNo matter what Ashamane thought, there would be a connection between them. There was another realm, a wild, untouched place called the Emerald Dream. Keeper Freya had used it to seed life all across Azeroth, and thus, the Wild Gods were bound to it. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nEventually Ashamane came to Mount Hyjal to experience the Dream for herself, and she was immediately taken with this thriving vision of an untamed world. The panther made her home on the western slopes of the Well of Eternity and spent thousands of years drifting in the Emerald Dream, exploring its mysteries and power.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Fangs of Ashamane, Part Five</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAshamane, like many Wild Gods, lived apart from the burgeoning civilizations that rose and fell across Azeroth. The Zandalari trolls held no interest for her. Many elves saw themselves as ascendant, too enlightened to be bothered with the natural world. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut there came a time when she could no longer ignore Azeroth. The Emerald Dream shook with the arrival of the Burning Legion. Eventually a disciple of another powerful being, Cenarius, called upon the Wild Gods for aid.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nFor Ashamane, her duty was clear. She rushed into battle with the Burning Legion without hesitation. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nA new predator had come into her world. She was glad to hunt it.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Fangs of Ashamane, Part Six</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nBy the time the Wild Gods joined the War of the Ancients, the fighting had spread far beyond the Well of Eternity.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe demons who strayed into the forests outside Zin-Azshari soon learned to tread carefully; Ashamane stalked the trees. Her fangs ended the war for many Burning Legion scouts. So greatly was she feared that the Legion took to burning down entire swaths of forest before attempting to advance past her. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIf the demons believed they would have better luck fighting on an open battlefield, they were sorely mistaken. Ashamane was enraged by their tactics, and she joined other Wild Gods, elves, and additional creatures in attacking the Legion\'s flanks, ripping huge holes in their battle lines.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Fangs of Ashamane, Part Seven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThere seemed to be no end to the demons\' numbers. When Ashamane fought the Burning Legion ten thousand years ago, her instincts told her that the invaders had specific prey in mind. Tearing herself away from the thick of the battle around Zin-Azshari, she tracked raiding parties that had determinedly cut their way northwest.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIt was not easy to keep up. The demons set their best warriors to discourage pursuit, and Ashamane had to fight every step of the way.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut she was not deterred. Those who stood in her path fell, one after another.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAs she closed in on her prey, she understood their target: they were aiming to claim Suramar. This is why Ashamane is so honored by the druids of Val\'sharah--what she did next has never been forgotten.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Fangs of Ashamane, Part Eight</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAn army of demons was preparing to lay siege to Suramar. Ashamane faced it alone. She had never visited the forests near Val\'sharah before, but that did not matter. They were the wilds, and thus, they were her home. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nShe ripped through the demons\' ranks and then disappeared into the trees. She crept along the high branches and dove down upon the Legion commanders. She was a terror, a fearsome beast, and she held nothing back, offering no mercy.\r\n<BR/><BR/>It was a slaughter. And yet even a Wild God could not avoid injury at the Burning Legion\'s hands. Scorched by fel fire and poisoned by their tainted weapons, Ashamane fought on, thinning their ranks until their leader was forced to face her himself.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThat had been her plan all along. It was one of the laws of survival: the pack was not defeated until its leader\'s throat was between her jaws.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Fangs of Ashamane, Part Nine</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nA Burning Legion general had volunteered to oversee the conquest of Suramar. This pit lord, Ronokon, saw endless rewards in the elven city and wanted to claim them in Sargeras\'s name. He became enraged by Ashamane\'s interference and stepped forth to personally deal with her.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe Wild God and the annihilan general dueled in the forests of Val\'sharah for hours. He was a cunning fighter. He knew how fast she could kill, so he kept her at bay with his jagged, fel-wrought spear, content to inflict small, grazing wounds.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAfter so much war, Ashamane\'s strength was finally beginning to fade. Her wounds ached. Her pace slowed. But her will was unbroken. With the last of her strength, she leapt at Ronokon, allowing him to drive his spear through her chest. Yet her claws dug into his shoulders, and her fangs sank deep within his neck.\r\n<BR/><BR/>Ronokon thrashed madly, trying to pull the panther away, but she held on. Her teeth remained embedded in his throat until he died. His death brought more destruction. The fel power granted to him by the Legion exploded outward, tearing a deep gash in the land and burning Ashamane to ash.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nHer sacrifice was not in vain. Suramar\'s residents had been given enough time to hide their city from the Legion and the world, protecting themselves from the Sundering that would follow.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Fangs of Ashamane, Part Ten</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe land around Val\'sharah had been altered forever. Where there had once been a hill, now there were a cliff and a deep valley. It took many years for the druids to restore nature in the area to its previous beauty. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nDespite the lingering traces of Ronokon\'s corruption, there was always a sense that something was opposing it, helping to sweep it away. Some druids came to believe that Ashamane\'s spirit, even after death, was still committed to the fight against the invaders who had threatened her wilds.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Fangs of Ashamane, Part Eleven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe druids built a shrine at the site of the pit lord\'s death to commemorate Ashamane\'s courage. Her fangs--all that survived the violence of her passing--were placed there to honor her unbending heart and untamed nature.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nTo this day, Ashamane is remembered as one of the fiercest defenders of Azeroth. \r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Claws of Ursoc, Part One</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nUrsoc\'s legacy is known to every druid on Azeroth. As one of the great Wild Gods, he challenged the Burning Legion ten thousand years ago and bravely laid down his life in defense of this world.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nHe was a true guardian. He believed in the power of the wilds, and he never hesitated even for a moment to leap to their defense.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut now he can rest. Others will need to continue his work.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Claws of Ursoc, Part Two</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nMany millennia ago, two inquisitive bear cubs roamed the area around the Grizzly Hills together. These brothers, named Ursoc and Ursol, had more curiosity than good sense, and they frequently found themselves trespassing in the domains of bigger predators. Danger did not discourage them, and each one never left the other behind, even when circumstances seemed dire.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThey caught the attention of Keeper Freya, who was traveling across Azeroth in search of exceptional wild animals. Freya recognized their potential and saw what they would become. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nWhen they matured, they grew stronger and bigger than any other bears in the Grizzly Hills, and they did not suffer the ravages of aging.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nUrsoc and Ursol became known as Wild Gods.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Claws of Ursoc, Part Three</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nPerhaps the most unusual gift Keeper Freya gave the two bears was the ability to speak. A few other Wild Gods, particularly those who would become known as the August Celestials, also received this gift. While they were chosen for their intelligence, the two bears were chosen for their stubborn bravery.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nFreya believed that Ursoc and Ursol would one day change. When they finally saw enough of Azeroth to satisfy their curiosity, they would be compelled to protect it from any enemy that would threaten it. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nShe knew them well. Ursoc, the older of the two bears, had a strong protective streak. The more he saw of the wilds of Azeroth, the more he felt it was his responsibility to preserve them.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Claws of Ursoc, Part Four</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nKeeper Freya saw how the instincts of the Wild Gods matured over the years, and she noticed that some of them were natural guardians of their domain. For those creatures, she began to create unique weapons, items that would aid them in times of trouble... but these artifacts would only become as strong as their wielder made them. Their true potential could only be unlocked with practice, nurture, and self-improvement. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSome Wild Gods did not understand what Freya had given them, and they neglected their weapons. Ursoc was not one of them. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Freya gave Ursoc new claws, fashioned out of a rare material called titansteel and imbued with a small portion of the essence of Eonar, one of the titans. These claws could grow in length and were nearly indestructible.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nUrsoc had no intention of letting them waste away and decay. He dedicated himself to mastering their power.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Claws of Ursoc, Part Five</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nOnce Ursoc received his new claws, he trained tirelessly. Every day he traveled long distances and sparred with his brother, testing his strength. Over the years he grew stronger. Much stronger. Ursol had received a gift, too, a staff that eased the use of magic, and he soon mastered his own power. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nUrsoc\'s titansteel claws became an extension of his body, and Ursol became an expert in manipulating the flows of magical essence.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nTogether they had become some of the most powerful Wild Gods in existence... and they would soon become known as Azeroth\'s staunchest defenders.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Claws of Ursoc, Part Six</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nEventually Ursoc and Ursol accompanied Keeper Freya on her journeys across Azeroth. She confided in them that she sensed dark forces at work, and they made sure she was safe. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAs they traveled with her, they received their first glimpses of the Emerald Dream, the realm Freya had created to guide Azeroth\'s natural life. They spent as much time as they could within those untouched wilds, drawn to the Dream\'s thriving, vibrant vision of nature.\r\n<BR/><BR/>One day, Freya asked to travel alone. To both Ursoc and Ursol, it sounded as if she was bidding them farewell. Before she left them, she offered more wisdom about their weapons and their other gifts, and she told them to remain prepared. "Azeroth will need you. If you do not stand ready, the world may fall," she said. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe Wild Gods never saw her again. The darkness that had claimed the mind of Keeper Loken had also corrupted hers.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Claws of Ursoc, Part Seven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nTen thousand years ago, a threat unlike any other set its gaze upon Azeroth. The Burning Legion, after corrupting important members of the elven civilization near the Well of Eternity, invaded with all of its might and fury. The first druid, Malfurion, called upon the Wild Gods to fight back against the demonic hordes.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nUrsoc and Ursol were the first two Wild Gods to respond. They rushed into battle with the Legion\'s doomguard, landing the initial blows in the war between Azeroth\'s wilds and a fallen titan\'s twisted army.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIt was a desperate fight against overwhelming odds. Neither brother hesitated for an instant, and even when the full wrath of the Burning Legion was brought against them, they did not run.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThey fought until their last breaths.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Claws of Ursoc, Part Eight</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nMany Wild Gods perished in the war against the Legion. Ursol and Ursoc remained together, fighting back to back, using Freya\'s gifts to bring down waves of demonic enemies. But their strength had limits. An unending tide of felstalkers finally overwhelmed them, and they both died in battle. Their spirits traveled together to the Emerald Dream, where they stayed for millennia.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nUrsoc\'s claws were all that remained of him in the physical world. When the fighting moved elsewhere, a young furbolg found the titansteel claws. Recognizing whom they had belonged to, he took them to his tribe.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nFor generations, those furbolgs worshiped the claws as the final sign of their bear god Ursoc.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Claws of Ursoc, Part Nine</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nFew furbolgs had the courage to try to wield Ursoc\'s claws in battle. Every time they did, the results were horrifying. Ursoc had spent untold years mastering their power and unlocking their potential; in the hands of an untrained mortal, they inspired an uncontrollable bloodlust that lashed out at friends as easily as enemies.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAfter a number of attempts, the claws ceased to have any effect at all on the furbolgs. No matter what rituals they tried, it seemed as though the power in the claws had become dormant.\r\n<BR/><BR/>Ursoc\'s spirit, standing guard in the Emerald Dream, had simply seen enough. The furbolg tribe was not capable of controlling his power, so he withdrew it from the claws. It would not return until someone worthy claimed them.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nMembers of the Druids of the Claw eventually brought the titansteel-wrought artifact to Ursoc in the Emerald Dream.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Claws of Ursoc, Part Ten</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nUrsoc\'s desire to protect Azeroth had not wavered, even after death. He and Ursol roamed the Emerald Dream, searching for any signs of corruption or darkness taking root in the realm.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nRecently, the return of the Emerald Nightmare drew their attention. Ursoc fought Xavius, the lord of the satyrs and a pawn of evil forces, in an attempt to eradicate the Nightmare\'s influence.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nFor a second time, Ursoc made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of Azeroth.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">The Claws of Ursoc, Part Eleven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nNow Ursoc can finally rest. Ursol, his brother, continues his watch inside the Emerald Dream, fighting against the Nightmare.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nUrsoc\'s claws no longer belong to the Wild Gods but to those who can carry on their work. Only someone with a guardian spirit as determined as his will be able to wield them in battle.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAnd woe unto any enemy that has to face a creature as dedicated as he. \r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

Without help, nature would not have risen at all. The titans knew this. One of their final acts of aid for us was to give the keepers the knowledge and power to reverse the Old Gods\' unspeakable destruction.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIn time, nature would rise. Life would flourish. Generations of plants and animals would grow and change.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThis miraculous recovery did not come from any one place. But at the beginning, there was a source of healing and balance, a place where all life could rest and revive.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIt was called G\'Hanir, the Mother Tree.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

To aid in this task, she shaped a mystical realm that would become known as the Emerald Dream. She wanted it to be an unspoiled vision of nature, undisturbed by the forces of evil or external civilizations.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nShe began by creating a single, massive tree, set atop a high peak within the Dream. From it bloomed many different fruits and flowers, and new life flowed outward in waves, sweeping across the land. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nFreya sculpted pools of life in other locations within the Emerald Dream, but this tree was the first, the tallest, and the most radiant. For millennia, it served as a source of healing and balance that extended beyond the Dream and into the physical world.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">G\'Hanir, the Mother Tree, Part Three</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAs life flourished on Azeroth, generations of animals came and went. Soon the Emerald Dream was filled with the spirits of countless beasts.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThat first tree that Freya had created, G\'Hanir, became a haven for winged creatures. Its many boughs and branches had room for all, and its healing, peaceful energy calmed even the most distressed minds.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nMany powerful spirits were drawn to G\'Hanir. Some wanted to simply gaze upon it; others wanted to sit at its base and bask in its shade for a while.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nOne never left. A Wild God named Aviana made the Mother Tree her home for as long as she lived.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

She was a predator, delighting in swooping down on prey from the sky. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nEventually she was called something new: the Mistress of the Mother Tree. She had grown utterly enchanted with G\'Hanir. It was more than a tree; it was a source of life, healing, and peace. Aviana spent years melding her power into the tree, and soon all living winged creatures on Azeroth dreamed of spending the afterlife flying through its branches.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAviana\'s spirit became intertwined with the Mother Tree.

					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">G\'Hanir, the Mother Tree, Part Five</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nTen thousand years ago, Azeroth was invaded. The Burning Legion stormed onto our lands and waged war on all who would resist it. There were few people inclined to fight back, and they were greatly outnumbered.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe first druid, Malfurion Stormrage, called upon the Wild Gods to join the fight. Not only would a Legion victory eradicate the elves, but it would also spell doom for all life on Azeroth.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nMany Wild Gods answered Malfurion\'s cry.

Surely they had not been expecting nature to produce such powerful enemies. That day will never be forgotten as long as Azeroth remains free of the Legion\'s control.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAviana led flocks of birds from all the land on the hunt for Legion minions. Untold numbers of demons died to her and her children.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut the Burning Legion\'s forces were too great.

Many mourned for it, and some succumbed to the temptation of serving dark forces in Aviana\'s absence.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut although she had died, her spirit still lingered.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAs the night elves struggled to rebuild their society in the wake of the Sundering, members of the green dragonflight discovered a gift. A single branch of G\'Hanir, with a single acorn hanging off its leaves, had been left in their keeping in the Emerald Dream. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe acorn was used by Alexstrasza, Aspect of the red dragonflight, to create Nordrassil, the great World Tree that would protect the second Well of Eternity.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

Many of Aviana\'s children had been lost to chaos, and they might be driven to claim any remnant of her legacy for their new masters.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nQuietly, Malfurion moved the branch of G\'Hanir to a safe location deep within the Emerald Dream. Only a few people ever knew where it was kept, but its influence was felt far and wide.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nFor many millennia, the branch served as a stabilizing force for the Emerald Dream, and the land near it was said to be a place of great healing and peace. \r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

As the night elves fought to repel the forces of Ragnaros from Mount Hyjal, they asked the champions of Azeroth to summon new allies--or, to be specific, old ones.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nMany of the Wild Gods who had died in the War of the Ancients were resurrected. Aviana returned to life on Azeroth and joined the Horde and the Alliance in successfully pushing the elemental forces back into the Firelands. In the end, Ragnaros was killed, and Mount Hyjal was saved.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAviana turned her attention to G\'Hanir once again. Times had changed, but her dream of providing a spiritual haven for her kind had not. She set out to restore the Mother Tree to its full glory.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

Unbeknownst to the druids, the forces of the Emerald Nightmare were already gathering for an assault. When they investigated key sources of power within the Dream, they discovered the true nature of G\'Hanir.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe satyr lord Xavius, working on behalf of the Burning Legion to taint the Dream, ordered his forces to exercise caution. This branch of G\'Hanir was corrupted slowly, very slowly, in such ways that even its guardians could not sense it.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nWhen the Nightmare revealed itself, this branch suddenly pulsed with evil. Had it been left corrupted, it might have thrown the entire Emerald Dream into chaos.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSince it has been cleansed, that plan, at least, was thwarted.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

The Nightmare covets the branch\'s power; obscurity will no longer suffice. The strength of the Mother Tree must be used to drive the forces of evil away from Azeroth. Aviana agrees, and sends it off with her blessing.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nPerhaps one day this branch will be returned to the Dream to once again bring peace and stability to the realm. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut for now, its true value will be in the hands of a champion.

					'Huginn and Muninn perched on a branch overlooking their master. The big vrykul sat relaxed below eating a particularly lush plum while reading from ancient tablets. The juice from the fruit went drip, drip, drip upon the stone as one turned to the other and cawed.\r\n\r\n"What does it say? What is he reading?" asked Muninn.\r\n\r\nHuginn bobbed his head up and down, peering intently with one eye at the rune stone below.\r\n\r\n"I cannot read!" the large raven exclaimed. "You know this. Why do you taunt me?" Huginn pecked in frustration at his companion.\r\n\r\nMuninn defecated, missing the vrykul below by mere inches.\r\n\r\n"We should get him to fashion us something. An eye... caw!" Muninn insisted.\r\n\r\nHuginn agreed with his own caw as the vrykul peered up at the two ravens whom only he could understand.\r\n\r\n"If you two will give me some peace, I will make you something that will let you read anything your little bird brains desire," Havi said. "Now be quiet."\r\n\r\n...',
					'Time passed, but differently for the ravens as it does for all immortals. They spent centuries reading everything they could get their hands on through the lens of their precious Raven\'s Eye. Countless days were spent deciphering old, weatherworn runic carvings in languages long since dead. They were happy. Well, as happy as ravens can be, which is to say, no one believes that they can ever truly be happy. Not even ravens.\r\n\r\nThen the day came when the stranger arrived. An elf, one of those new kaldorei, the night elves as everyone else was referring to them. The little people were always so much more annoying than the vrykul. But somehow, this one was different. And he had something in his hand that was the sweetest smelling thing they had ever experienced.\r\n\r\n"What is that you have there, my fine-feathered friends," the bearded kaldorei asked.',
					'"Caw!" was the reply that he received, as only their master could understand them. But, the power of the Raven\'s Eye allowed them to understand him perfectly. They had long ago learned all of the languages of the small mortal races.\r\n\r\n"The three of us share something in common, for my name is Ravencrest. You might say we are kin after a fashion," the night elf explained, his voice strangely soothing. "May I try to read that tablet? It looks awfully interesting." And with that, the elf slowly edged a little closer to see the runes written upon the stone.\r\n\r\nHuginn and Muninn were transfixed by the smell of whatever mysterious delight this Ravencrest held in his closed fist. Their heads bobbed up and down uncontrollably to try to get just the slightest peek at what it might be. They let him move closer.\r\n\r\nWhat danger could a mere elf pose?',
					'The night elf\'s brow furrowed and he frowned. He was staring at the tablet that the ravens had been reading, a funny story about a stupid little boy and girl who were tricked by a clever vrykul witch and then eaten.\r\n\r\n"Alas, I cannot read this. I do not know the ancient runes of the honorable and proud vrykul people," the Ravencrest confessed. He sighed loudly and his shoulders slumped. "I know that ravens are the smartest of all Azeroth\'s creatures, but how is it that the two of you can read this timeworn scrawl?" he coyly asked.\r\n\r\nMuninn, ever the suspicious one, pierced the stranger with a look from this left eye, only darting a quick glance once or twice, perhaps three times, at the elf\'s closed hand to make certain that whatever was in there had not disappeared.',
					'But, before the doubtful bird could stop him, his more trusting brother gave their secret away. Huginn rapped three times upon their most prized possession. Despite the sharpness of the raven\'s beak, no scratch marred the facets of the perfect, magical jewel.\r\n\r\n"Oh, how wonderful! Are you saying that bauble allows you to read the stone?" the sly elf queried. The two birds sat staring at him, their chests puffing up and their hackles rising.\r\n\r\n"No, no, friends, you mistake me. I only wish to borrow your jewel. Please, let me use it to read the runes," the elf requested." After, we can all have a lively discussion about whatever story is written upon the stone. In return, I will give you this."\r\n\r\nThe Ravencrest finally revealed what he had been concealing within his hand. To the ravens, it was perhaps the most amazing thing they had ever seen or smelled, second only to Havi\'s jewel.',
					"Slowly, the kaldorei placed the hard piece of elven candy on a nearby rock. The ravens twisted their heads back and forth between the jewel, the elf, and the treat. But, it was not long before their nature overtook them and they hopped over to the rock. The candy was delicious, better than anything they had ever eaten, even the food of the gods within the Halls of Valor. They pecked and nibbled at the pieces for what seemed a heavenly age.\r\n\r\nWhen they were done, the two looked up expectantly, hoping that their newfound friend had another piece of the sweet. But, the elf was nowhere to be seen and neither was the Raven's Eye.\r\n\r\nHuginn and Muninn cawed and cawed as loud as they could. And as they took wing, they vowed a solemn oath to one day have their revenge upon the trickster elf and all of his kind.",

					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fu Zan, the Wanderer\'s Companion,<BR/>Part One</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nLong ago, Keeper Freya sculpted an ethereal plane of existence, the Emerald Dream, to act as a guide for Azeroth\'s natural life. She crafted and planted one tree near the powerful energy of the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIt grew strong and tall, drinking deeply from the vale\'s resonant power. More trees arose around it. Lush forests, both in the Dream and in the waking world, sprang to life across the region. Keeper Freya named the tree Fu Zan and shaped one of its branches into a walking stick for her long journeys. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nFrom the beginning, this staff has accompanied legendary creatures and immortal spirits as they carried out important, lasting work all across Azeroth. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIt also fell into the possession of the Monkey King. That came later.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fu Zan, the Wanderer\'s Companion,<BR/>Part Two</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nIn the early days of Azeroth\'s revival, natural life flourished strongly in the enclaves where the keeper Freya did her most intensive work. A small number of exceptional wild animals grew far beyond expectations, showing such remarkable power that they would soon be known as the Wild Gods.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nEach of these beings had a different personality, but Freya noticed that four in particular shared a deep commitment to peace and wisdom. These four-a serpent, an ox, a crane, and a tiger-had gathered near the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. Freya knew their compassion would aid the region well. Indeed, they would be called the August Celestials by the inhabitants of Pandaria.\r\n<BR/><BR/>One day, Freya came to the celestials with concern in her heart. There was a great darkness in the north, she told them, and she believed a confrontation was near. She gave them her staff for safekeeping. "If I do not see you again, return this staff to Azeroth, to one of its children," she said. "Give it to someone who loathes battle and loves peace."\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nFreya never returned. Yu\'lon, the Jade Serpent, vowed to keep the staff safe. For thousands of years, even during the dark reign of the mogu empire, she did just that. \r\n\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fu Zan, the Wanderer\'s Companion,<BR/>Part Three</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nIn the south, near the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, many new creatures arose, forming tribes, villages, and even empires. There were the jinyu, the pandaren, the hozen, and others.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nYu\'lon suspected that, if Fu Zan would pass to one of these beings, it would go to a jinyu or a pandaren. Surely the hozen were too innately violent to be trusted with such a gift. They were often selfish and shortsighted, unable to work together long enough to build a proper civilization of their own.\r\n<BR/><BR/>But as time passed, Yu\'lon questioned her assumptions. There were different forms of wisdom and courage, were there not? It was easy to see the short-lived, short-tempered hozen as troublemakers, but they lived full lives-wild lives-in the years they had.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nYu\'lon felt Fu Zan begin to awaken. It needed a new companion. The Jade Serpent knew that soon she would honor Freya\'s wishes and allow a worthy mortal to carry Fu Zan. And she was becoming certain that it needed to be given to a hozen.\r\n\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fu Zan, the Wanderer\'s Companion,<BR/>Part Four</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\n"Give it to someone who loathes battle and loves peace."\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nFreya\'s words became clear the moment Yu\'lon laid eyes upon one exceptional hozen. He called himself the Monkey King. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nLong ago, only a few years before the War of the Ancients, he had become the leader of an ungovernable people. He had risen to power without spilling a single drop of blood. He was beloved by every hozen tribe.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nHow had he done this? After all, hozen fought endlessly. Constantly. For the simplest reasons. Any disagreement meant physical violence.\r\n<BR/><BR/>The Monkey King knew this. So he told the hozen tribes, "I am the Monkey King. Your tribe supports me with all its heart." That was all. When a single hozen would question him, he would tell them that their tribe\'s leader had already agreed to it. No hozen wanted to challenge their leader on a whim-and be in a fight-so they declared, "You are the Monkey King." \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nWhen the tribe leaders learned his name, all of their subjects were already calling him the Monkey King. They were confused, but they did not want to fight their people, so they did not challenge him either. The Monkey King\'s wild claim, his lie, eventually became true because nobody dared to disagree with it.\r\n<BR/><BR/>Soon tribal fighting had ceased. The Monkey King passed judgment on all disputes. The hozen obeyed.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe Jade Serpent could see the Monkey King\'s motivation. It was simple: he disliked the sight of blood. At the most fundamental level, this was a creature who loathed battle and loved peace. And from that, he had achieved what no other hozen ever had.\r\n\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fu Zan, the Wanderer\'s Companion,<BR/>Part Five</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nYu\'lon needed to know how deep the Monkey King\'s cleverness ran. She visited him in disguise. All the Monkey King saw was another hozen... but this one did not call him king or bow before him. He demanded that she show respect. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nInstead, the newcomer asked him a riddle, telling him that a true king would have no trouble answering it. He snapped out the correct answer in seconds. She gave him another. He answered again. On and on they went, for three days and three nights. The Monkey King grew enraged, but even in his anger, he continued to answer her questions.\r\n<BR/><BR/>Yu\'lon was convinced. Violence and tyranny were not in the Monkey King\'s nature, or he would have tried to shut her up with force long ago. She revealed her true form-which caused considerable chaos in that hozen village-and presented him with Fu Zan. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe Jade Serpent told him the story of Freya and how the staff had come to be. Then she warned him: she sensed that, one day, his cleverness would not be enough to stop evil. When that day came, he would need to act decisively. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe Monkey King did not believe her. But he did think the staff was very, very pretty.\r\n\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fu Zan, the Wanderer\'s Companion,<BR/>Part Six</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nWith Fu Zan in his grasp, the Monkey King\'s authority over the hozen became absolute. He could bend like a willow in the wind, avoiding any blow from a challenger to the throne. The staff was as light as a feather, and yet anyone who tried to steal it found they could not lift it an inch. It was his; no one else was allowed to wield it.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut there was a serious problem with Fu Zan. To look regal while carrying it, the Monkey King needed to use two hands. That meant he had no free hand for his most prized possession, a small keg that he always kept filled with brew. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut that was easy to solve. The Monkey King had two metal bands added to the end of Fu Zan and hung his keg from them. Luckily, the staff was not permanently damaged. \r\n\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fu Zan, the Wanderer\'s Companion,<BR/>Part Seven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe Monkey King became fast friends with a young pandaren prince, Shaohao. The day of Shaohao\'s coronation, the new emperor learned that all of the land was at risk of being destroyed by the Burning Legion\'s first invasion of Azeroth.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe Monkey King believed that Yu\'lon\'s prophecy had come to pass: this was the day he needed to face evil directly. He declared that he would stay by Shaohao\'s side until the end.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut fate had other plans. A great, ill wind roared from the east and carried the Monkey King far away. \r\n<BR/><BR/>The Monkey King was blown into the lands of the mantid. All of his cleverness counted for nothing there. He was helpless, about to die at their hands, when Shaohao rescued him. The Monkey King was enraged, but the mantid were not his enemy. Shaohao reminded him that the Burning Legion was the true threat.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAnd in the end, it was not violence that saved the peoples of Pandaria. Shaohao released his spirit to the land, shrouding it in mist and protecting it from the destruction of the Sundering.\r\n\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fu Zan, the Wanderer\'s Companion,<BR/>Part Eight</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe Monkey King went home and hurled Fu Zan into a river in a fit of rage. His friend had vanished, and the Monkey King had seemingly failed Yu\'lon\'s prophecy.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nEventually he went to the river to retrieve the staff, but only because those waters were sacred for a jinyu tribe, and they could not remove it themselves-it was too heavy. It still belonged to the Monkey King.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAfter the Sundering, Pandaria was isolated from the rest of the world. The emperor was gone. There would never be another. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSome believed that all the other lands had been destroyed. Others wanted to explore the world beyond the mists. And a few wanted to claim Pandaria for themselves. With force.\r\n<BR/><BR/>Not much has been written of this brief surge of would-be tyrants. Very few of Pandaria\'s denizens were harmed by any of them. Whether they were mogu warlords, fringe hozen tribes, or even brutal yaungol raiders, none of them ever launched a true campaign of conquest. Before they could, they were always approached by a mysterious hozen who would chatter endlessly about a hidden cache of artifacts that had granted him untold power. He could demonstrate miracles-no weapon could touch him, no matter how many combatants tried to attack him.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIt was very convincing. These ambitious, greedy beings would eagerly follow the Monkey King\'s directions. Sometimes they would walk off a cliff. Sometimes they would find themselves ambushed by Shado-Pan. In any case, their story always came to a quick end, and the Monkey King would stride away, Fu Zan resting easily across his shoulders.\r\n\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fu Zan, the Wanderer\'s Companion,<BR/>Part Nine</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe Monkey King had never had such fun. Turning evil beings into stumbling fools became his most cherished pastime for years. He saw it as his way of honoring his old friend Shaohao, who now watched over the land but could no longer protect Pandaria\'s peoples directly.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut just as Yu\'lon had told him, his cleverness would one day not be enough to defeat evil.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nA mogu despot called the Jade Warlord had followed the Monkey King\'s directions, traveling deep into a tomb beneath Kun-Lai. But rather than finding nothing--as the hozen had expected--the Jade Warlord found an ancient cache of knowledge written by the Thunder King, Lei Shen. In the warlord\'s hands, it would grant him terrible, awful power.\r\n<BR/><BR/>The Monkey King knew he had made a mistake... and as the ground began to shake, he knew there was no time for anyone else to stop the mogu. He took Fu Zan and went into the tomb to deal with the problem directly.\r\n\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fu Zan, the Wanderer\'s Companion,<BR/>Part Ten</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe Monkey King loathed violence. He detested it. But he also knew he was the only one who could oppose the Jade Warlord before it was too late.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe two of them dueled beneath Kun-Lai for hours. For years, Fu Zan had been an aid to the Monkey King\'s mischief-that proved to be excellent practice for avoiding the powerful, lethal magic the mogu soon unleashed. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe Monkey King believed he would not leave the tomb alive that day. Indeed, he did not. But he was not killed. The Jade Warlord had no command of his new power, and an errant spell did what neither of them expected: it froze them both in jade. They remained there, locked in battle, for almost ten thousand years, able to communicate all the while. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThat must have been a fate worse than death for the mogu.\r\n\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fu Zan, the Wanderer\'s Companion,<BR/>Part Eleven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nOnce the Monkey King was freed, he traveled to the Timeless Isle and watched as the August Celestials taught the champions of Azeroth lessons in strength, endurance, courage, and wisdom. After some time had passed, the Monkey King sensed that his travels with Fu Zan were nearing their end. So, he traveled to the temple of Yu\'lon and passed the staff back into her care so that one day it can again be given up to another who is worthy to wield it.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nHe was even happy to hear that it would soon be carried into battle again. \r\n\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

Four animal spirits were drawn to that place, the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, and they were in awe at its potential... and its power. At that time, dark forces had eyes on the vale\'s secrets. A titan keeper and his armies of mogu protected the land from the mantid and other outside threats, but there was no guidance for what was growing within.<BR/><BR/>\r\nThese four spirits chose to make this place their home. They were Xuen, the White Tiger; Yu\'lon, the Jade Serpent; Chi-Ji, the Red Crane; and Niuzao, the Black Ox. They would become known as the August Celestials. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Under their care, many different life forms emerged near the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. Among them were the wise jinyu, the mischievous hozen, and the peaceful pandaren. They worshipped the August Celestials, and in return, the spirits offered them knowledge and guidance. For a time, there was peace.\r\n\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Sheilun, Staff of the Mists, Part Three</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe peace of the vale did not last. The terror of the Thunder King shattered everything. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nA mogu warlord named Lei Shen revolted against his master, the keeper Ra-den, seizing his power and crowning himself the emperor of all mogu... and of all who lived within his domain. He enslaved those who surrendered and killed those who did not. First he conquered the small, fledgling jinyu empire and their hozen rivals. The pandaren fled to the harsh climate of Kun-Lai Summit, seeking the protection of Xuen, the White Tiger.\r\n<BR/><BR/>Xuen offered them sanctuary for a time. But soon, Lei Shen brought an army to the Kun-Lai foothills. Rather than launching an attack, he issued a challenge: Xuen would come forth and duel with the Thunder King. Victory meant the pandaren would live free. Defeat meant the enslavement of them all. Refusal meant summary execution.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nXuen accepted the challenge. The duel between the celestial of strength and the Thunder King shook the skies for days. In the end, Xuen fell. Lei Shen did not have him killed; instead he took him to the highest peak, Mount Neverest, and had him bound there, forced to watch the pandaren being led into an era of slavery that would last for thousands of years.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut although Xuen was imprisoned, he was not idle. It is here that the story of this staff truly begins.\r\n\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Sheilun, Staff of the Mists, Part Four</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nFor millennia, Xuen was alone, able to do nothing but watch the mogu empire inflict unforgivable cruelty on its slaves. Then he saw the seeds of revolution take hold. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIt began with a single pandaren, Kang, who believed the mogu empire\'s reliance on slave labor made it weak. He learned how to fight without weapons, using the strength of his opponents against them, and taught it to many others. Soon he and his followers escaped to Kun-Lai, where they honed their abilities and philosophies in secret. One day Kang climbed to the top of Mount Neverest to meditate, and instead found Xuen. \r\n<BR/><BR/>The White Tiger\'s isolation had not made him angry or bitter. It had simply made him eager to help. He guided Kang and the other novice monks in the ways of strength-not simply the strength of raw power, but the strength of endurance. "Look to the little life you can find in these heights," Xuen told him, "and you will know strength."\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nKang looked, and saw scattered, isolated trees growing along the Kun-Lai ridgelines. They were twisted and gnarled, but he soon understood they needed to be. They had to endure biting winds and harsh sleet. Their trunks needed to be sturdy and strong, their roots deep.\r\n<BR/><BR/>It was those trees that formed the walls of the monks\' monastery and supplied the wood from which they crafted their first weapons-not blades, as their enemies had, but staves. Kang brought his to Xuen, who blessed it. Kang named it "Sheilun," after his son, who had died to the mogu\'s cruelty years before. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nKang carried Sheilun for years, all throughout the Pandaren Revolution. The staff did not win the war. It was Kang\'s words that galvanized the mogu\'s slaves, and it was Kang\'s will that drove him onward when all seemed lost. On some days, Sheilun was a mere walking stick. But some days it was all that kept the mogu\'s swords and axes from carving his heart from his chest. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSheilun was there the day Kang died, as he gave his life to topple the last mogu emperor. With that sacrifice, the former slave freed all of Pandaria. \r\n\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Sheilun, Staff of the Mists, Part Five</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nSheilun was brought back to the monastery in the mountains, serving as a quiet symbol of what could be accomplished through the strength of inner harmony. The monastery itself, however, was not quiet at all. It had never been busier. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nXuen warned the monks that, although they were free, they had inherited the responsibility to protect Pandaria from the evil minds that wished to claim it. Every one hundred years, the mantid--dangerous insectoid creatures--would swarm the land. All that stood in their way were the brave souls who would fight atop the Serpent\'s Spine, a great wall protecting Pandaria from the mantid\'s ravaging mayhem.\r\n<BR/><BR/>The monks who remained in Kun-Lai dedicated themselves to preparing for this threat. And every one hundred years, pandaren monks lined the top of the Serpent\'s Spine to face the overwhelming waves of mantid and risk their lives to protect their land. Xuen would always allow one mistweaver to carry Sheilun into this centennial battle. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIt is impossible to say how many lives were saved by those who carried this staff. It is impossible to say how many of its bearers died in service to Pandaria. But their sacrifices were not in vain. The wall still stands, even today. \r\n\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Sheilun, Staff of the Mists, Part Six</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAlmost ten thousand years ago, this staff passed into the possession of the last emperor of Pandaria. Perhaps you\'ve heard his story. But please understand: before Emperor Shaohao became a legend, he was an untested, uncertain young pandaren, completely unaware of the burdens he would bear. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nOn the day of Shaohao\'s coronation, a monk from Kun-Lai presented him with the gift of Sheilun. The new emperor did not know its importance. He did not even recognize the monk as being sent by Xuen, the White Tiger; he merely thought it was a pretty ornament. Shaohao believed he was destined for a life of comfort and ease. Pandaria had been a peaceful land for generations. Why would he believe that would change?\r\n<BR/><BR/>A jinyu waterspeaker received a vision of the future that shook Shaohao\'s confidence: soon, very soon, an army of demons would invade Azeroth, and the damage would be catastrophic. Pandaria would not survive the devastation that would follow.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nShaohao was greatly distressed. He sought out the advice of Yu\'lon, the Jade Serpent, who told him he would save no one if he did not rein in his emotions, which were out of control and dangerous.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nShaohao would travel Pandaria in search of the wisdom that would save his land. This staff, Xuen\'s gift, it accompanied him. This journey would change Pandaria forever.\r\n\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Sheilun, Staff of the Mists, Part Seven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nShaohao set out on his travels with his friend, the mischievous and playful Monkey King. Before they got far, a great wind surrounded them. The Monkey King was carried away, disappearing into the distance. It was an event unlike any Shaohao had ever seen, and he soon found himself struggling to keep up.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nDoubt and despair rose up in the emperor\'s mind... and then they rose up outside of his mind, taking form as monstrous creatures. When the Jade Serpent told him his emotions were dangerous, she had been speaking of the sha, ancient shadows of a fallen Old God. The terrifying Sha of Doubt and the Sha of Despair confronted Shaohao. To dispel them, Shaohao had to listen to Chi-Ji, the Red Crane, and let go of those emotions, ridding himself of their burdens. \r\n<BR/><BR/>He continued his pursuit of his friend, following him all the way across the Serpent\'s Spine and into the land of the mantid.\r\n\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Sheilun, Staff of the Mists, Part Eight</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nWhen Shaohao looked upon the mantid lands from the Serpent\'s Spine, he was frozen with fear. To cross into their territory was to risk almost certain death. The Sha of Fear held him immobile, paralyzing his thoughts. Niuzao, the Black Ox, was there to remind him that fear only controlled his mind, not his feet. Shaohao understood, wrested himself free of fear, and walked on.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nShaohao saved the Monkey King from the mantid\'s clutches and brought them both back to safety. Now, without fear or despair or doubt, Shaohao believed himself ready to face the Burning Legion\'s might. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut he saw no need to face it alone. He wanted an army to command, so he climbed Kun-Lai... and finally came face to face with Xuen.\r\n\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Sheilun, Staff of the Mists, Part Nine</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe monastery atop Kun-Lai had changed over the years. What had once been the only refuge for free minds was now the training grounds for the most dedicated fighters in the land. These were the souls who trained to fight the mantid and all of Pandaria\'s other enemies. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nShaohao came to them confidently, demanding that they submit to his authority. Xuen saw that he was carrying his coronation gift-this staff, Sheilun-but that it had been nothing more to him than a walking stick. The White Tiger also saw that the emperor had rid himself of a great many dangerous emotions... but not anger. No, Shaohao\'s anger toward the Legion made him brash and reckless.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"Why do you fight?" Xuen asked.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"To destroy demon hordes! To crush those that oppose me!" Shaohao declared.\r\n<BR/><BR/>Xuen offered a simple challenge: "Strike a single one of these monks, and you will have command of them all." Shaohao accepted. He swung Sheilun over and over again, but he struck nothing at all. The monks were too skilled. They easily evaded him.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nShaohao\'s humiliation and anger built up, and then they exploded. A great darkness burst forth from him, and in his rage, Shaohao broke Sheilun over his knee and lashed out with the power of the Sha of Anger. When he regained his senses, a monk lay dead, the victim of Shaohao\'s unchecked aggression.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nXuen watched the emperor\'s heart break for the life he had taken. And then Shaohao knelt humbly, accepting his failure, ridding himself of anger forever. \r\n<BR/><BR/>"Again I ask, why do you fight?" Xuen said.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"For the people I protect," Shaohao replied. "For them, I would give my final breath."\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nShaohao was now ready to fulfill his destiny. He took one half of the broken staff and returned to the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, prepared to save Pandaria.\r\n\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Sheilun, Staff of the Mists, Part Ten</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe Legion had invaded to the north. A great battle was taking place at the Well of Eternity. And soon, very soon, it would end. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nShaohao returned to his people and tried to give them confidence, but there was none to be given. The Sundering was at hand, and its fury would change the face of Azeroth forever. There was nothing that could be done to stop it.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAll Shaohao could do was shield them from annihilation. With Sheilun in his grasp, Shaohao committed his final breath to protecting his land and all who lived within it. This staff had saved countless lives before-and in one moment, it saved countless more.\r\n<BR/><BR/>Free of all his burdens and negative emotions, Shaohao became one with the land. Through Sheilun, his spirit was transformed, surrounding Pandaria as a great mist.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nPandaria drifted away, immune to the chaos that gripped the rest of the world. The Sundering passed the land by, and for thousands of years, the mists would continue to protect Pandaria.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut although Shaohao disappeared that day, Sheilun remained. \r\n\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Sheilun, Staff of the Mists, Part Eleven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nSheilun was found shortly after Shaohao\'s ascension. Monks brought it to the Terrace of Endless Spring for safekeeping, where it stayed for millennia. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSeveral generations ago, a mistweaver master wrote at length about its history and meaning. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"It was not Sheilun that prompted Shaohao to make his sacrifice. It was not Sheilun that inspired Kang\'s revolution that freed his people. It was not Sheilun that kept the Serpent\'s Spine standing against countless mantid cycles. But it was there for all of those events, in the possession of people who could act. It is the perfect companion to those willing to sacrifice everything in order to save others. And I believe it has not yet found its final bearer." \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n-Master Xunsu, Mistweaver of the Terrace of Endless Spring\r\n\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

It was good that you cut down Typhinius so quickly. Had he gone unopposed, he might have become truly unstoppable once he mastered these weapons. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut now the Fists of the Heavens are in your hands. You have a balanced heart; you seek harmony in all things. There is perhaps no other creature on Azeroth more capable of wielding this hurricane of power than you.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fists of the Heavens, Part One</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nIt has not been long since Uldum was revealed to the world, and thus, many fragments of the tol\'vir\'s history are still hidden from us. Still, it is becoming clear: the Fists of the Heavens are some of the finest weapons their society ever crafted. And they are also some of the most dangerous artifacts the world has ever seen.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThere are tales of an ancient weaponsmith, a master without peer among the tol\'vir. His name was Irmaat. His name is known to all surviving tol\'vir as one of the most exceptional minds to have lived in Uldum... and also as a cautionary lesson. Irmaat was driven to create incredible works, but his pride turned out to be his undoing.\r\n\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fists of the Heavens, Part Two</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe titans created the tol\'vir to protect key locations across Azeroth. Over the millennia, some fell to the forces of darkness. For a very, very long time, Uldum did not. Irmaat, its weaponsmith, worked tirelessly to arm his brethren with the finest instruments possible. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nFor Irmaat, his work was not simply a duty. It was his calling. He saw his hands as extensions of the titans\' will, and he wanted nothing less than to give his creations the ability to restore order to all chaos. He began to imbue his weapons with magic, using different sources of power to inspire him.\r\n<BR/><BR/>The power of air in particular held a special interest to him. He secretly observed the Skywall, the realm of air in the Elemental Plane, and studied the way its creatures lived and fought. Irmaat forged four scimitars, representing four extraordinary djinn lords. And then, in a ritual that stunned the tol\'vir with its audacity, Irmaat summoned and bound those very four lords within the weapons themselves. Their power now belonged to the tol\'vir.\r\n\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fists of the Heavens, Part Three</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nIrmaat\'s four scimitars became highly coveted among tol\'vir warriors. Stories of their power rapidly spread, and messengers came from other tol\'vir outposts, begging Irmaat for more of those wonders. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut the weaponsmith\'s satisfaction was short-lived. He had accomplished something great, but it was not perfect. Irmaat had seen for himself the true elemental power of the Skywall. Even the captured might of four djinns was but a light breeze compared to the ultimate power of that realm.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIrmaat carefully began crafting two new weapons. Not scimitars this time. Two smaller weapons, one to be held in each hand. He named them Al\'burq and Alra\'ed, and he intended for them to control a power that, by its nature, could never be tamed. \r\n\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fists of the Heavens, Part Four</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nAfter Irmaat forged his new weapons, he declared them to be his finest work. These "fists of the heavens" would be capable of commanding the wind itself. All that was left was to capture the ultimate power within the Skywall: the elemental lord Al\'Akir.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIrmaat began the ritual slowly, not wanting to warn the Windlord of his plan. It took weeks of preparation, but once he was ready, it was over in an instant. The weaponsmith cast his spell, intending to open a portal to the Skywall and bind Al\'Akir\'s essence. There was a great flash of light and a great rush of air, and when it was done, Irmaat could feel his weapons, Al\'burq and Alra\'ed, trembling with elemental power.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nHe believed he had succeeded. He believed he had accomplished the impossible. His surety was what led to his death.\r\n\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fists of the Heavens, Part Five</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nOf all the elemental lords, Al\'Akir was known to be the cleverest. When Irmaat captured four of his most prized lieutenants, the Windlord was filled with wrath, but he recognized an opportunity to exact vengeance. He suspected that Irmaat\'s pride would drive him onward.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nWhen Irmaat\'s spell concluded, he felt Al\'Akir\'s power quivering. But it was not the elemental lord\'s spirit; it was Al\'Akir\'s trap. When Irmaat hefted his two weapons and tested the power within them, uncontrollable fury spilled forth. \r\n<BR/><BR/>The weaponsmith, his forge, and a number of buildings within Uldum were destroyed by the hurricane of might that had been unleashed. The weapons themselves were hurled miles away. The unfortunate tol\'vir who first tried to recover them were similarly destroyed. Al\'Akir had made Irmaat\'s greatest creations unusable, filled with so much power that nobody could ever hope to control them. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe tol\'vir carefully locked the weapons away, burying them deep. For millennia, nobody dared to touch them or repeat Irmaat\'s folly. Al\'Akir\'s lesson had been learned very well.\r\n\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fists of the Heavens, Part Six</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe events of the Cataclysm changed Azeroth forever. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nUldum was revealed to the world. The remnants of the tol\'vir came under assault. Al\'Akir and another elemental lord were slain by Azeroth\'s champions. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nWe have only begun to feel the ripple effects of those events. We do know that the death of Al\'Akir left a power vacuum among the air elementals. His surviving subordinates went to war with one another, scrambling to secure leadership of the Skywall. None found any immediate advantage, for none were as powerful or as clever as their master had been.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut one djinn, Typhinius, sensed that there were still scraps of Al\'Akir\'s power out there. The Fists of the Heavens would not stay buried for much longer.\r\n\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fists of the Heavens, Part Seven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nLingering rifts in the Skywall allowed Typhinius to leave quietly and hunt for something that would elevate him above his kin. He let his senses guide him and was led to an empty, nondescript part of the desert outside Uldum. When he dug into the sand, he found what the tol\'vir had buried: the Fists of the Heavens, Irmaat\'s last creation.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nTyphinius realized that, though Al\'Akir was dead, the weapons\' elemental chaos remained--but it seemed to be slightly, just slightly, more stable than when the Windlord lived. Still, when the djinn first wielded the weapons, the resulting burst of power nearly destroyed him. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut slowly and secretly, Typhinius learned how to keep his old master\'s power under control. \r\n\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fists of the Heavens, Part Eight</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nWhen Typhinius returned to the Skywall with the Fists of the Heavens in his grasp, he immediately set out to end the air elementals\' civil war. It was not simply his raw power that quelled them. They sensed the essence of their old master, and it compelled them to obey. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThere were those who refused, of course. Other djinns believed that they could band together and overcome Typhinius\'s borrowed strength. A huge battle nearly ripped apart the Vortex Pinnacle, and a brutal clash in the Temple of Asaad saw tremendous losses on all sides.\r\n<BR/><BR/>In the end, Typhinius was not the cleverest. He was simply the strongest, and he overpowered his enemies. He flung the spirits of those who had opposed him into the other elemental realms. Alone, they could not stop their natural enemies from finishing them off in a slow and agonizing fashion. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nTyphinius declared that he was the rightful heir to Al\'Akir, and that he would finish what the Windlord had started. \r\n\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fists of the Heavens, Part Nine</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe war in the Skywall had caused more damage than Typhinius realized. It would take time for the air elementals to regain their strength and prepare for a full offensive.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nTyphinius had no interest in waiting. The moment he felt the Burning Legion invade Azeroth, he knew that the mortal champions of the world would be preoccupied. He told his minions that there would be no better time. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe raids on Uldum began almost immediately. The Fists of the Heavens swept away all early resistance. \r\n\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fists of the Heavens, Part Ten</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nTyphinius\'s assault on Uldum was a serious strategic error. The civil war had not long passed, and the fighting power of the air elementals was still weaker than it might have been only a few months later.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe only advantage they had were the weapons Al\'burq and Alra\'ed, but even Typhinius had not mastered their true potential yet. He could unleash carnage, yes, but most of his efforts had to be spent keeping Al\'Akir\'s fury from ripping him apart.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nTyphinius\'s pride was fortunate for Azeroth. His ambition drew attention, and it was that attention that led to the discovery of his plans. He launched his war too soon, and even these weapons could not save him.\r\n\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Fists of the Heavens, Part Eleven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nThe history of these weapons is marked with pride. The power that they contain can only be harnessed by a balanced mind and a harmonious spirit. Any arrogance, any cockiness, will inevitably lead to ruin for their wielders. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBut if you are already practiced in walking with the wind... the Fists of the Heavens will finally have a master who can make them truly legendary. \r\n\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

					"Oct 8.\r\n\r\nAs I have said before, I am becoming increasingly disturbed by the dangerously vast potential of certain schools of magic, and the contrasting amount of laws and boundaries that should be set to limit them. Furthermore, comprehensive research on these volatile schools shows a trend of decreasing academic prerequisites yielding increasingly powerful outcomes. \r\n",
					'A student of mine asked me today, "Why are there so many limitations on traditional portals, when Fel portals can be made twice as large and last ten times as long?" The student was not yet educated in the abstraction of what is practical versus what is achievable, yet the question held within me a certain duality: What future is there for the established practices of magic when so many wild variations threaten to overshadow them? \r\n',
					'I do all I can to stifle studies of Fel magics and necromancy here, yet I find myself both disturbed and enthralled by their potential. I refuse to believe that that their efficiency so soundly trumps the common criticisms of being unstable or "evil" that these schools hold the monopoly of avenues for magical progress. Yet when witnessing the massive infernal for one\'s self, or seeing acres of land blighted at the wave of a hand, I fear my beliefs may soon shift from gospel to dogma in the minds of my peers.\r\n',
					"Oct 16.\r\n\r\nMy primary focus has shifted to research of the plague that ravages the north. I've canceled most of my classes to focus on research of this terrible anomaly. \r\nWith immense precaution I've procured a shipment of the infested grain. Immediately I was both impressed and suspicious with how innocuous the whole package presented itself. There was no discoloration, no discernable odor, and no variation at all from any other sheaf of grain. \r\nAt that moment it was no longer a mystery how this plague spread so quickly. \r\n",
					"Oct 17.\r\nFurther study of the plague has yielded disturbing conclusions, and even more disturbing implications. \r\nInitial testing showed the plague had only minor effects on non-human creatures. Symptoms ranged from fatigue, nausea, fever, to minor hallucinations, but rarely resulted in death. On human tissue, however, the plague acts uniformly and with unprecedented expediency towards necrosis.\r\n",
					"It would be foolish to think that such an efficient human killer only being found in human rations is a coincidence. While it's certainly possible that these two occurrences are unrelated, I've decided to delegate more resources towards finding the source of this plague, for I fear there are intelligent hands pushing it upon our kin. \r\n\r\nMore research must be done here at Dalaran, however. I will decide who to send to investigate in my stead at a later date, after some heavy deliberation. ",
					"Oct 18.\r\n\r\nI've stumbled upon a key factor of this plague, one so cleverly hidden in its methodology that I've come to two immutable conclusions: That its development was for the singular purpose of ending human life, and its inception was at the hands of an intelligent being. \r\nLong term affliction of the plague causes a certain reanimation of activity in the dead. This activity is very small at first, and I disregarded it as a minor side-effect. However, this energy remained persistent and unwavering. A thought struck me, one which was both surprising and strong: The corpse was waiting for something. \r\n",
					"At that moment I did not have any evidence to prove it, but I nonetheless I spent time pursuing it. I used my limited knowledge of necromancy and casted simple curses on the corpse. At the time I had no motivation to raise the dead, only to change or distinguish the radiating energy off the corpse. Imagine my surprise when it sprung to life and attacked me.\r\n",
					"I did not hesitate to incinerate it to dust, and I now I regret doing so. But I was able to prove my unprovoked theory, that the corpse (and by extension the plague that saturates it) was indeed waiting for further commands. It's clear that those who die by this plague are only lying dormant in their graves, awaiting one skillful in necromancy to awaken them.\r\n\r\n In short, it is indisputable that the plague is magical in nature.  \r\n",
					"Oct 20.\r\n\r\nI have decided to send my most trusted disciple, Jaina Proudmoore, to investigate the source of the plague. Based on my research, I believe only my most skillful disciple will be able to handle the unknown challenges that await such an endeavor. She will take with her a copy of this journal and my other research documents regarding the plague. Indeed I will make it public, for all people need to become aware of this imminent threat. \r\n",
					"I only wish I could investigate it myself, but Terenas has proven to be predictably stubborn to my requests. It is paramount that I convince him to quarantine the north. Little else matters at this point in time. Regardless, I have the fullest faith in Jaina's cunning. If she or I cannot put an end to this infestation, I doubt anyone can.\r\n\r\n-Antonidas-\r\n<This is marked with the seal of the Council of Six>\r\n",

The vrykul taught their primitive children the ways of foraging, of masonry and smithing, and of making war.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBy the time of Warlord Thoradin, the vrykul of the human lands had long since died out. What little remained of their presence included weapons they had left behind. The humans treated these arms as sacred heirlooms and symbols of their tribes.

If they did not unite, the moss-skinned trolls would crush humankind and desecrate its ancestral lands.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"So it was that Thoradin declared himself king and set out to bring the tribes to heel. Many he won to his side through the marriages of his sons and daughters. Others, through promises of wealth and land. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"But some closed their ears to words of diplomacy.

Though the upstart king was confident he could subdue the tribe if given enough time, he knew the cost would be very high. To prevent unnecessary bloodshed, he changed his tactics. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThoradin shed his battle armor and painted his chest with Arathi tribal symbols. With only Strom\'kar in hand, he marched up the mountain and challenged the Alteraci leader, Ignaeus, to a duel. \r\n<BR/><BR/>Before long, Ignaeus emerged from the forest, skin dyed red with his own tribal marks, blade sharpened and hungry for death. He dwarfed Thoradin in size and strength, but the Arathi leader had other advantages. He had chosen the duel on a day when thick fog enveloped the mountains. Using the weather to his advantage, Thoradin eluded Ignaeus\'s wild swings and disarmed his bigger foe.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIgnaeus was at Thoradin\'s mercy, but the Arathi leader did not strike.

A great warrior named Lordain led the region\'s noble people. They would not submit to shows of force like the Alteraci. To win their loyalty, Thoradin needed to appeal to their religious beliefs.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThus Thoradin and his personal guards made a pilgrimage to the region\'s shrines and sacred groves. At each site, the king performed rituals as was the custom of Lordain and his kin. Thoradin even wore a pendant of the silver hand, an image held sacred by Tirisfal\'s humans.\r\n<BR/><BR/>At the end of the pilgrimage, Thoradin met with Lordain. The king pledged that if the tribe joined him, he would adopt their mystic ways and spread them among the Arathi. To seal his promise, Thoradin ran his palm along Strom\'kar\'s edge and mixed his blood with the earth of Tirisfal.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThe histories record Thoradin as saying, "Between our people, let this be the only blood we spill."\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nAnd so it was.

With this in mind, it\'s quite extraordinary that Thoradin convinced all of the human tribal leaders to lend him their personal blades. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"Arathi blacksmiths took shards of metal from each of these weapons and added them to Thoradin\'s greatsword. It was an act of brilliance, for it secured the eternal loyalty of the tribes.

If the king built his capital there, his people would prosper.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThoradin sought out the land from his dream, a region known today as the Arathi Highlands. As the story goes, the king spied a black wolf roaming the barren terrain. On that spot, Thoradin used Strom\'kar to carve out the boundaries of his city in the dirt. Then he set his masons to work.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nSo arose Strom, mighty capital of the first human kingdom.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

King Thoradin took part in many of these skirmishes, often at great risk to his own life.\r\n<BR/><BR/> \r\nOne account tells of a brutal Amani ambush that struck Thoradin\'s forces. The trolls routed the humans, separating the king from his warriors. Though he was outnumbered ten to one, Thoradin did not flee. He did not beg. He did not cower. No true Arathi would stain his honor with such craven acts.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThoradin sharpened Strom\'kar\'s edge on the skulls of his enemies and painted its steel with their blood.

King Thoradin marshaled over twenty thousand human soldiers and launched his armies at the trolls. The decisive battle unfolded at Alterac Fortress. The Amani host besieged the stronghold. While the humans defended the fortress from the onslaught, the high elves smashed into the troll rearguard. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"Thoradin waded through the Amani warbands with the rest of his soldiers, Strom\'kar hacking down troll after troll. Once the king knew his forces had worn the enemy thin, he revealed his secret weapon.\r\n<BR/><BR/>"One hundred human magi emerged from Alterac Fortress. Alongside elven sorcerers, they pooled their power and unleashed a single terrible spell on the Amani. A column of fire ripped down from the heavens and blasted through the trolls. The howling torrent of flame burned the Amani to ash. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n"Thus the Troll Wars ended, with human and elf triumphant."\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

The king created a military pact so that each side would help the other if the Amani ever threatened their lands again. He also carved out new territorial borders with the elves and drew up trade agreements to foster the prosperity of Arathor for generations to come.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBefore Thoradin left Quel\'Thalas, the elves gave him a gift. Their greatest blacksmiths and enchanters toiled over Strom\'kar and imbued it with extraordinary power. Thoradin marveled at the masterwork of the elves. The new Strom\'kar gleamed with an otherworldly beauty. It weighed almost nothing in Thoradin\'s hands, and no matter how often he used it, the edge never seemed to dull.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

He broke tradition and kept Strom\'kar as his own. Though some bristled at what they considered an act of greed, Thoradin retained the blade for practical reasons. Strom\'kar had become a symbol of kingship. Thoradin wanted Arathor\'s citizenry to see his bloodline as the legitimate rulers, not simply whoever wielded the sword.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nFree from the burden of leadership, Thoradin spent much of his time studying ancient ruins in Tirisfal Glades. He became obsessed with the origins of humankind and with the tales of giants who once walked the land. Thoradin learned to use Strom\'kar\'s enchantments to locate hidden places of power.\r\n<BR/><BR/>During one of his journeys in Tirisfal, Thoradin and a retinue of his followers entered mysterious catacombs buried beneath the earth. According to the legends, none of them were ever seen again.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',
					'<HTML><BODY>\r\n<H2 align="center">Strom\'kar, the Warbreaker, Part Eleven</H2>\r\n<HR/>\r\n<P>\r\nMany strange tales exist about what befell Thoradin, but the truth is the strangest of them all. In Tirisfal Glades, he discovered two long-lost subterranean chambers. One belonged to the noble keeper Tyr. The other, to a monstrosity known as Zakajz, a bloodthirsty servant of the malevolent Old Gods. \r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nBefore written history, Tyr had sacrificed himself to defeat Zakajz in a battle that shook the heart of Azeroth. The keeper\'s allies buried both combatants at the site of their mythic confrontation, and they sealed the tomb with magical wards to prevent anyone from disturbing what lay inside.\r\n<BR/><BR/>Unaware of the great darkness locked beneath the earth, Thoradin instructed the magi in his retinue to break the seals. They succeeded... and, in so doing, their arcane spellwork inadvertently resurrected Zakajz. As the lumbering creature tore through Thoradin\'s followers, the former king did not flee. He did not beg. He did not cower. No true Arathi would stain his honor with such craven acts.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nThoradin sharpened Strom\'kar\'s edge one last time, burying the sword into Zakajz\'s skull. The blade\'s elven enchantments forced the horror into a deep slumber and prevented it from regenerating.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\nIt was Thoradin\'s last great act. At the moment of his strike, he suffered a mortal wound from Zakajz. The warrior who united humankind died that day, Strom\'kar stained with the blood of one final enemy.\r\n</P>\r\n</BODY></HTML>',

					"Abjuration is the study of protective magic and one of the most important schools for a young mage to study. The most generalized abjuration spell is the mana shield, a spell that transmutes raw mana into a barrier that protects the caster from attacks. Properly executed, this spell can protect the mage against even the most formidable of attacks - but the mana shield is very difficult for a novice to master. It often takes a mage months of practice to even conjure a simple mana shield, and thus, more basic alternatives exist.\r\n",
					"A series of elemental armor spells were invented to aid the traveling mage in the unfortunate case that he or she might be attacked. These spells require far less raw energy to cast than a mana shield and are more easily maintained over time, but lack the raw potency of the mana shield. Rather than stopping an attack completely, a frost armor spell might simply decrease the effectiveness of the assault. The more advanced armor spells grant other benefits - for example, the potent mage armor spell actually assists the caster in regaining magical power more easily.",

It is for this reason that the 'Ward' spells exist. Ward spells are quick, potent incantations to protect the caster against a form of elemental damage - damage which is often caused by the caster attempting one of the other schools of magic. This is why studying abjuration early is so imperative.",
					"One of the most renowned practitioners of Abjuration magic is Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider. While the prince is quite formidable in all schools of magic, Kael'thas has created a variation of Mana Shield that is practically unsurpassed in among the residents of Dalaran. Also notable is the Arcanist Doan, who has perfected a spell that combines Evocation and Abjuration to shield himself for a short time while preparing a powerful area-of-effect spell. This 'Detonate' spell provides Doan with a degree of near invulnerability for a precious few seconds, but few mages have the capacity to cast it safely.",

For many years, he worked diligently throughout the outlying areas of Azeroth, bringing relief to the suffering and swift justice to evildoers.\r\n\r\nHe was married to a young girl named Lys in the summer of his eighteenth year. They were much in love with each other and would eventually produce three children, a son and two daughters.\r\n\r\nMorgan was thirty-two when war broke out in",
					"Lordaeron. Morgan was called to the side of the legendary paladin Uther the Lightbringer to fight against the orcs and the undead. Leaving his wife and children in the safety of his home, Morgan left for war.\r\n\r\nThe years passed and the war dragged on, and Morgan would witness many horrific events, including the disbanding of the Paladins of the Silver Hand, the death of Uther and the spread of the plague. The only thing that kept him from the brink of madness was the knowledge that he would",
					"someday be reunited with his wife and children.\r\n\r\nMorgan would eventually return to his homeland, but find it nothing like how he remembered it. The once verdant forest was corrupted and teemed with the undead and other dark forces. Destroyed houses and farms could be found everywhere, and the cemetery near Raven Hill now dominated much of the area. A shocked and bewildered Morgan eventually made his way to his home, only to find it in ruins. Not knowing what had befallen his homeland, he",
					"headed towards the village to find answers, and, he hoped, his wife and children.\r\n\r\nMorgan inquired about his family, but could not find any answers. A priest in Darkshire, as it was now called, said that he might search the cemetery at Raven Hill for a gravestone. Morgan refused to believe that his family was dead, and continued to search every farm and house in Duskwood, but to no avail.\r\n\r\nMorgan rode from Darkshire to nearby Lakeshire, thinking that perhaps his family had fled. On his way",
					"there, he decided, against his better judgment, to stop by the Raven Hill cemetery. Morgan spent hours walking amongst the gravestones. He recognized many names of people that he knew and became more and more distraught. Then he saw them: a small, untended plot amongst the many with three small gravestones. A feeling of dread washed over him as he approached. Morgan brushed off the dust of the most prominent gravestone to reveal the name on it. Simply carved upon the grave, letters spelled out",
					"his worst fear:\r\n\r\nLys Ladimore\r\nBeloved Wife and Mother\r\n\r\nMorgan's apprehension turned to dismay and then to grief, and he fell to his knees weeping. For hours he stared at that one grave, begging the cold stone for forgiveness and sobbing apologies. Then, hours later, something in him snapped, and he began to lash out. He brought his sword out of its scabbard and began to rain blows on the gravestones, screaming in rage. Blind in his fury, he lashed out and swung wildly, catching the notice",
					"of a trio of the cemetery's attendants. As they tried to restrain him, he turned his focus to them, hurling accusations of guilt upon the innocent attendants, then killed them all.\r\n\r\nLater, when the rage had passed, realization crept into Morgan's mind, and he saw his bloody sword driven into the chest of one of the attendants. Driven to the brink by his emotions, he removed his belt knife and plunged it into his heart.\r\n\r\nMorgan Ladimore's body and the three bodies of his victims were found",
					"the next day. He was quickly buried, without ceremony, in a hastily dug grave on the outskirts of the cemetery. Because Morgan committed murder against innocents, something that went completely against his beliefs and his nature, and because of the grief that he held in being unable to save his family, Morgan could not die a peaceful death, and lived on as one of the restless dead.\r\n\r\nOnly days later, his grave was disturbed, and his body could not be found. The being that was Morgan now",

Known for humble yet hardworking residents, Darrowshire stayed in the background of Lordaeron history until the Second War.\r\n\r\nHeroes were made during that war.  And heroes were lost.",
					"The Battle of Darrowshire\r\n\r\nThe Battle of Darrowshire took place in the middle of the Second War, when scourge forces rampaged across Lordaeron.  Darrowshire was cut off from the bulk of Alliance forces, but the town was bolstered by a company of troops, a contingent of paladins of the Silver Hand, and a staunch group of local militia led by Captain Joseph Redpath.",
					"The Scourge's first assaults on Darrowshire were sparse.  Small groups of marauding skeletons and corpses wandered the outskirts of the village and were easily defeated.  \r\n\r\nBut the Scourge sensed the defenders' tenacity, and responded in kind; soon after the first wave of attacks a second wave emerged.  Champion ghouls, servants of the ghoul lord Horgus, screamed down from the hills and clashed with beleaguered Darrowshire defenders.",
					"The Defenders weakened, but were relieved by paladins, disciples of the Silver Hand.  Their leader, Davil Crokford, was a native of Darrowshire.  He brought his followers to the village when he heard of the impending attack, and together with the defenders they held back the servants of Horgus.\r\n\r\nWhen Horgus himself entered the battle, he met with Davil.  For many minutes they fought and Davil eventually prevailed, but he suffered a mortal wound and died soon after defeating the ghoul lord.",
					"The battle continued, and Captain Redpath led his militia bravely.  And it might have been won, had the captain not been corrupted by the death knight Marduk the Black.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the fray Marduk rode up to Redpath, and with black magic he tore loose Redpath's spirit, twisting it into an evil shadow of the brave captain.",
					"The corrupted Captain Redpath then spread his evil taint among the defenders of Darrowshire, who betrayed their allies and slaughtered them.  They then turned on the town of Darrowshire and killed all who hid in their homes.\r\n\r\nThe remaining scourge army, along with the corrupted spirit of Captain Redpath, then left the ravaged village of Darrowshire and tore into Lordaeron, adding to the pain and death of the Second War.",
					"The Fate of Horgus the Ravager\r\n\r\nHorgus the Ravager fell at the Battle of Darrowshire.  But the evil within him was not fully spent.  The victorious Scourge forces removed his skull from the battlefield of Darrowshire, carrying it with them to sow dread among the living they faced.\r\n\r\nDays later, the company of Scourge who possessed the head were defeated by Silver Hand Paladins.  Horgus' head was cast into Blackwood Lake.",
					"The Fate of Marduk the Black\r\n\r\nMarduk survived the Second War, causing great death and suffering with his foul, rune-laden sword.  Although Marduk still lives, his sword was lost in a battle near Corin's Crossing.  A dwarf captain shattered the sword on his enchanted shield, forcing Marduk to flee the field and winning the day for the Alliance.\r\n\r\nMarduk's sword sank into the earth and corrupted it, eating a gorge into the land, now known as the Infectis Scar.",
					"The Fate of Davil Lightfire\r\n\r\nDavil Lightfire died at the Battle of Darrowshire, but his bravery inspired the Alliance throughout the war.\r\n\r\nHis book, his paladin's libram, was recovered by Scarlet Crusade troops.  It now resides in the town hall of the Scarlet Crusade controlled Hearthglen, often read by crusaders eager to draw from Davil's strength.",
					"The Fate of Joseph Redpath\r\n\r\nJoseph Redpath was killed during the Battle of Darrowshire.  His spirit was corrupted and took new shape, and this creature spread great evil in Lordaeron.\r\n\r\nAt Gahrron's Withering, east of Andorhal, the corrupted Redpath was finally defeated by Alliance forces.  His shield still rests near the barn of the plagued farmstead, and Scourge minions are still drawn to the memory of his evil.",
					"The Fate of Carlin Redpath\r\n\r\nBrother to Captain Joseph Redpath, Carlin fell during the battle of Darrowshire.  But although terribly wounded, he was not slain.\r\n\r\nDays after the battle, agents of the Argent Dawn found Carlin wandering, weak from thirst and fever, near Corin's Crossing.  They tended to his wounds and brought him to the Light's Hope Chapel.\r\n\r\nGrateful for their charity, Carlin joined the ranks of the Argent Dawn and now fights a battle of revenge against the Scourge.",
