# Lorekeeper

This addon collects ingame text from book items and objects, and allows them to be read anywhere. To open the frame, a button on the Minimap and AddOn Compartment Frame are both provided, as well, as the slash command `/lorekeeper` or `/lorek`.

Eventually the plan is to implement a collection-based system and track progress on various achievements, not too unlike mount, pet, or transmog collection, but with a focus on ingame lore items. It will be a continuous work-in-progress, as collecting a baseline of known texts will take some time.

To help contribute your own data, you can submit your data on the [github issue template](https://github.com/keyboardturner/Lorekeeper/issues/new/choose) or place it in the `#addon-dev` channel in [my discord](https://discord.gg/vUMTdzPxqg). You'll need to find a file located here: `_retail_\WTF\Account\<YourAccountName or ID>\SavedVariables\Lorekeeper.lua` If you would like to be credited for your submission, please provide a username or some sort of online handle by which you want to be addressed as (this is public info in an addon). Do not include Lorekeeper_Mail.lua as it is *not* a necessary upload and contains your personal mail items and custom items. It will not be contributed to the addon.

Happy hunting!
